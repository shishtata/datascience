Visited this casino with my friend. Got refused to enter. Reason: My shirt was too wet. Asked the staff what I'm supposed to do if it's raining. Got told it's my own fault If i do not have my umbrella with me.,"experience, staff, access, weather, crowd, service, facilities, value, safety",negative
Amazing National Park and so close to Darwin!,"scenery, value, facilities, wildlife, access, experience",positive
"If the kitchen took less than the 40 minutes we waited for our lunch then I might not have noticed (in my boredom) the large cockroach walking across the carpet from the direction of the kitchen! After kicking the roach away (pic attached of him/her on their back) our average but edible food arrived which we finished and, in the remaining 30 minutes, no staff came to take away our dishes though they did take away the dishes at tables that people had long since left. The meals weren’t cheap so I expect better hygiene and meal quality than what we received.","food, facilities, service, experience, access, safety, cleanliness, value",neutral

"One of the most iconic places in Australia and just as I expected it did not disappointed me.
This famous rock is bigger than I expected, 2,5km long and 350m height.
From every corner of this rock you can admire its particular shapes levigated by rain and wind and its different colors in a shadow and sun light play.
We reached it from Alice Spring after 5 hours by bus but it’s worth it every minute we spent on long straight desert roads.","scenery, value, transport, access, weather, experience",positive
"Spent there 4 days in November 2023. not much to see, most „attractions“ where closed and in total the park is totally overrated. The service in the Cooinda lodge was rather poor compared to the prices they ask for staying there. We left one day earlier as planned. I would not recommend to go there, Georg","service, price, experience, facilities, scenery, access, staff, weather, safety, transport",negative

"Definitely not worth it for the price you pay. My partner and I stayed there for a week and were very disappointed.
There was mould all through out the room. The spa bath was not working so I asked reception about it. After 5 hours and 6 employees in my room it was finally fixed. The rooms are very outdated and do not even have smart tvs so you can only choose between a few free to air channels or a movie for $15-$20.
I ordered room service and the meal was terrible, couldn’t even finish it.
The service was average, took a long time to check in and told me poor directions to the gym.
The cleaners came in daily but never changed the sheets just remade the bed, I could tell because there was mould on the sheets.
Honestly save the money and stay somewhere else.","price, experience, service, facilities, staff, access, food, crowd, weather, scenery, safety, value, cleanliness",negative
Rooms are very basic and overpriced. Daily housekeeping needs improvement. The floors need to washed daily. It is not sufficient to just empty the trash and change the towels.,"facilities, cleanliness, price, service, access, experience, staff, value",negative
