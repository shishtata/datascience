"Do not purchase a park pass before going to a visitor center!

"STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!

I am writing to express my concerns regarding our current stay at your hotel in Room 112.

Upon entering the room, we noticed black mold on the ceiling, which raised immediate health and safety concerns. While we understand that issues like these can sometimes arise, we would have expected them to be addressed promptly for the safety and comfort of guests. We did not feel comfortable staying in a room with visible mold, and this significantly impacted our experience.

Additionally, during our stay, we encountered an issue with the Wi-Fi, which was not functional. When we raised this concern with the front desk, the response we received was dismissive, with the staff member implying that this was expected because we were in a remote area. Furthermore, another guest also dismissed our concerns, making us feel that our complaints were not taken seriously.

As a result, we felt that our experience was far below the standard that we expected from your establishment, particularly in terms of guest service and room conditions. While we understand that the location may have limitations, we believe it’s important to maintain a certain level of service and cleanliness for all guests, regardless of the setting.

We are only staying for one night, but I wanted to bring these issues to your attention so that future guests do not encounter the same problems.

"Thank you for the opportunity to review our stay.

We have travelled extensively both domestically and internationally and I must say our experience at Kakadu Crocodile Hotel was not a highlight.

Whilst the staff are great and the novel design concept sort of works the rooms are so outdated it is pathetic.

We had to ask for an additional chair as we only had the beds as a sitting option for 2 people.

No lounge chairs in the room and there is room for them.

Shower over bath – really ! Shower rose leaked badly.

NO lift – we were on the 1st floor and had to manage everything up the stairs.

No ceiling fan in the NT – it’s the ONLY place we stayed at that didn’t have one.

Size of fridge was hopeless for us to store our perishable supplies – the bar did give us extra ice for the esky which helped.

We didn’t eat there as the lady on reception recommended somewhere else…… which worked out great.

I would rate the accommodation at 2 stars.

Value for money  1 star.

14 rubbish in front garden for entire stay
15 outdoor shower dirty and didn’t work - tap handle fell off when we tested it.
16 furniture old and stained - even a burnt iron mark on the coffee table, amongst others

DONT EVER STAY HERE…… STAY AT VIBE AT THE DARWIN WATERFRONT …… much better location and I am sure the standards will be much higher than here - wouldn’t be hard really.

Paying super high room rates for a 5 star hotel - not sure how they got this rating….. but no more than a 3 stars in my opinion.  Extremely disappointed to say the least.

"Having paid nearly $1500 for a 2 night stay, the room we paid for (a superior lagoon room) was  severely sub-par. Also not having a bed there for my daughter who was staying with us and booked for. They then put us in the room next door which was exactly the same. They refused to help and gave us a “tough luck” attitude. We then had to pay an extra $150 to get the bare minimum, a room with a bed for my daughter.
After expressing how disappointed we were about the service, we were offered only $75 back with a “that’s the best we can do”
House keeping staff were lovely and very accommodating, bar staff were lovely, the pool was great, but the service of the management staff was 1/10.

"The Asian female dealer (Chinese I think, with a butterfly on her chest) at Poker table was really bad at customer service.

"My husband and I are visitors to Australia from UK.
This afternoon we came across a semi conscious aboriginal man in a ditch near Mindil Beach. He appeared in very poor shape. Not having Australian phones we rushed to the nearest place and reported what we had seen and asked the staff at the entrance of the casino to raise some help for the man. The staff said they would draw attention of the situation to their manager. An hour later the aboriginal man was still in the same position.  I gave him some water which sadly he was in no fit condition to drink and returned to the casino to find out what action had been taken.
On speaking with the manager we were told no action had been taken. I was told the man is outside the resort grounds and not their responsibility. I understand that and was not asking them to do anything to physically help personally, merely to phone the emergency services. They refused and refused even to allow me to make a call to the emergency services from their landline saying they did not have phones.
I am astounded at the stance the manager of the casino took.
A very kind passer by eventually helped us by logging a call with emergency services so that the aboriginal man could get medical assistance. I hope it was not too late as the man was in a bad state. I do not believe his problem was alcohol related.

"Stayed in the lagoon room and for the price I wouldn’t recommend it. We had a water leak from the ceiling, reported it and took them a few hours to come and look at it. Said they fixed it but it was still leaking. The leaking noise was pretty annoying all night long but we dealt with it. We were worried about slipping on the tiles so we had heaps of towels on the floor to mop it all up. Then a couple hours later the light stopped working which they didn’t fix either. They weren’t too concerned about fixing it or changing us to another room.

"I stayed in the lagoon suite and was very disappointed

The furniture was visibly stained and dirty. Staff themselves friendly but resort looks in a mess all the time with left over glasses and trays staying outside for days along with room services and housekeeping items

Reception staff are inconsistent when providing information and no 2 answer are the same. You stay here for thr luxury which all turned into a hassle. I wouldn't wait waste your money in the resort stick to a basic room.

They truly don't have the customer aspect down and not what you would expect from a resort hotel.

There was mould all through out the room. The spa bath was not working so I asked reception about it. After 5 hours and 6 employees in my room it was finally fixed.

"Security Guards at the Casino are heavy handed and will force you out at 3:40am even though the website states closing is 4:00am. Twice in 1 month I was forced to drink and get out when purchasing my drink at 3:30, walking back to my machine and sitting down. The security staff radioed other guards and stated I was being non compliant even though I was stating I was leaving. And even though I was out at 3:55 I have now been banned until further notice. I am not the only person to have been treated by Security in this manner. 2 guards even stated I used offensive language including the C you in the NT word which was a LIE! I, never use that word!!!!

"On Sunday night I attended the mindle markets , it’s was dark and we drove in we had  just arrived from interstate,  I had my small support Dog with me as I suffer from depression anxiety ptsd and adhd..
I was at the crocodile leather shop making a big purchase then this extremely rude thug of a security guard came up behind me and just started demanding me and my partner to leave because of some unreasonable no dog policy , ok where are the clearly marked signs , and it’s a public place.
I was in the middle  of making a 220 dollar purchase he didn’t even want to let me finish I told that he was  harassing me and my partner, she and I felt extremely threatened , it triggered my anxiety and ptsd response..
people around me saw and heard what was happening and were disgusted by what was going on as the thug security guard was adamant on forcing my partner and I out of this public place. I said wasn’t aware of this policy and where are no dog signs and will leave after I make this purchase, he refused to be reasonable instead He continued to be threatening and unprofessional as I was trying to pay for my 220 purchase.
We started to leave and then he started following my partner and I and continued to harass us . A group of about 10 concerned bystanders saw what was going on and came up to us as support just in case the security guard got violent.
We left feeling disappointed as this was  our welcome to Darwin.
The positive was the community support that came to our defence as they all saw the disgusting behaviour of this thug of a security guard.. well done to them there is hope..and shows the community’s real voice on this situation..

I will be now boycotting these markets out of principle I suggest the same for you as the markets have changed dramatically for the worst since the last time I was there 8 years ago.

"Brutal exploitation of the animals.
Prision for life without a crime.
It's shameful that these places are still legal in the 21st century.
Unscrupulous owners exploit ignorant people without compassion.
These animals should live in their natural habitat and not in ridiculous pools where they are visited by gawkers.

"The staff are kind & friendly but this is an establishment with a significant deferred maintenance problem. The rooms are grubby and rundown. Among the issues in my room alone (I didn’t venture into the outdoor areas):

- the air filter is filthy & clogged with lint (I’m sure it would contravene health regulations);
- the bathroom is tired and only superficially clean. (The bathroom should really be gutted and refitted but if there isn’t sufficient money to do that, a team of deep cleaners needs to come through the place to clean and sterilise the bathrooms from top to bottom.);
- the curtain rod has detached from the curtain, so the only way to open and close it is to grab the fabric, which adds to the grubbiness problem;
- the cushions on the lounge chairs need replacing - they have been compressed to the point that they no longer qualify as cushions;
- the fridge is old and incapable of adequate cooling (BTW, my fridge contained a water bottle with no water in it. I had to buy water from the supermarket);
- the overhead fan needs cleaning to remove the dust and lint that have accumulated, probably over years

The daily spit & polish performed by backpacker staff is obviously insufficient to deal with such issues. Nor is it an overnight fix, there is just too much to be done. What is required is a comprehensive management plan to work systematically through the deferred maintenance that has been backing up for years.

If my experience in the restaurant is anything to go by, I suspect understaffing may be partly to blame. Two or 3 pleasant but anxious young wait staff scurry about the place at buffet breakfast sittings while patrons resort to drinking hot tea out of glasses and eating cereal from plates because the cups and bowls have run out.

It pains me to record such things as I have no doubt everyone, including management, is doing their best. I suspect the fundamental problem here is declining revenue as people tighten their belts under cost of living pressures.

"I have traveled extensively around Australia and overseas throughout the last 30 years, and I’ve stayed in everything from 2-5 star hotels, most of which were an accurate reflection of their rating and price, and therefore offered satisfaction, however this hotel was a huge disappointment, and had I not committed to sightseeing activities for the second day of my visit, I would have cut my trip short by a day!

This hotel is 2-3 star at best; rooms are dated, poorly equipped, maintenance is lacking with the usual evidence; noisy air conditioning, cracked bathroom sink and floor tiles and an odour!

Despite my visit occurring in the wet season (low season) the prices are what you would expect to pay for a 4 star hotel in Sydney that comes with modern furnishings and quality dining.

"We paid  $748 for 2 nights at the hotel. Cold showers for this money is a disgrace. On contacting reception we were told it was because we were in the tail of the crocodile we needed to keep the water running. So we did. 20 mins of precious water down the drain to get a luke warm at best shower.
Not just our room. All 3 we had booked were the same.
Paid $35 per head for full breakfast. But be aware that hot breakfast is only scrambled eggs, so if you don't like them, it is not worth the high price. I was silly and thought I would have choice of at least fried or poached beside the scrambled.

The hotel is extremely tired looking and the WiFi not working because it's 'busy' isn't really acceptable given the price is hardly bargain basement. Don't get me started on the 'fridge'. I'd have better luck blowing on stuff to cool it down.

"I’m extremely disappointed with our recent stay in the Lagoon King Room on Friday, 21st March 2025. What should have been a relaxing family getaway to celebrate my birthday turned into a stressful and frustrating experience due to excessive noise from the neighbouring room. Between 9:00 PM and 6:00 AM, we were kept awake by loud arguments, swearing, fighting, and people constantly entering and exiting the room, with the door slamming repeatedly.
We reported the issue to reception during the night and again upon checkout, but all we received was an apology with no further resolution. For a hotel charging $550 for one night, I expected a much higher level of service and comfort. The lack of any compensation or effort to make things right was very disappointing.
Given the high cost of our stay, we feel that this experience did not reflect the standard of quality one would expect from a 5-star hotel. We had hoped for a peaceful, enjoyable stay, but instead were left with frustration and dissatisfaction.

"The resort ticked every box for me - location, comfort of rooms, staff, lagoon pool … however, on arrival a sign in the reception stated teens under 18 need to always be accompanied by an adult when moving through the resort. This ruined the entire experience, as I was visiting for work with my 16 and 17 year old sons. They were trapped in the room by day and couldn’t even attend to the lagoon pool alone or attend reception to pick up food deliveries. Poor housekeeping had a job of cleaning as we’d go days without it. When I returned from working all day, tired and needing rest, I wasn’t able to. I didn’t see this ‘rule’ when I booked the accommodation and wouldn’t have stayed there if I had. We successfully ignored the Casino and other areas (intentionally). It would be great if the resort (or casino) took more responsibility to check if minors are trying to enter areas they shouldn’t, so older teens can enjoy the experience too.

"Here's another hotel living off its position. My room wasn’t 4-star or luxury: it was basic, dated and in need of a good makeover. Housekeeping was shockingly poor and unreliable: no service at all on day 2, then 3 days of no servicing until I requested it mid-afternoon (when, instead of unwinding, I had to vacate my room again). At nearly $300 per night, I expect better.

Other low points included: centralised air-conditioning; a bathroom tap that fell off; sharing my room with a gecko; common areas stained and littered all day (or longer); being charged twice for 3 more days instead of being refunded for 3 (after complaining about housekeeping failures). So much for that relaxing break...

Sure, the sea views are great – even serial underinvestment can't spoil those - but you will pay (lots) more for the privilege, and see them from a ridiculously small, cramped balcony, of which half (literally) is taken up by an abandoned planter, now roughly covered with AstroTurf - stylish!

I won't be an inmate, sorry guest, here again. Stay in central Darwin for better choices of accommodation, bars and restaurants.

"Is it iconic? Yeah. Was it a beautiful spot? Yes. Was is it a once in a lifetime experience? I guess. Was it the best thing to see in any trip to Australia? No. And this is where my point lies. Ayers Rock is not the reason to visit Australia: in a 3-week trip to this beautiful country, it was the least impressive thing we saw. And the most expensive. Think about it. Are you willing to pay $600 roundtrip tickets to Ayers Rock from Sydney and spend over $400 a night in a monopoly of hotels whose rooms are worse than motels and also deal with thousands of flies that swarm on your face and clothes when you try to go on a hike? The site may be beautiful, but it is overhyped and overblown for what it really is: one rock in the middle of the desert. Is it a nice rock? Yeah, but it's not worth the price and compared to other beautiful sites in Australia (Twelve Apostles, the Blue Mountains, Cradle Mountain, Great Barrier Reef, Mountains around Cairns, Mt. Wellington, Hobart) it is on the same level of beauty, but less enjoyable to visit. Another misconception is that Uluru is the only place in Australia to see kangaroos in the wild. That is not true- there are 50 million kangaroos in that country and Ayers Rock might be one of the only places you can't see them in the country because they don't like the grass there. Just on the drive to the 12 Apostles from Melbourne, we saw a flock of Kangaroos. Also, there are plenty of them within an hours drive of Sydney.

There are no cooking facilities in the rooms, not even a microwave.  This then makes you have to use the Lodges meal facilities.  These are only open at certain times and is all al a carte.  Dinner and Breakfast are fine but, outside these times, you can only purchase snacks form the Shop.  There is plenty to purchase if you were camping, but not much if you cannot cook/reheat etc.  The idea of having a buffet lunch was awesome until we found out it was only for the tourist bus groups and after being rudely pushed out of the way by some seemingly very hungry individuals of said group, we gave up and fed on snacks.  It just seems to me that we are being pushed to use the bistro/bar to eat, as nothing else is available.",3.0,Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,the general overall feel and vibe of the lodge is great the layout and access are good the grounds are immaculate and the pricing is reasonable where it falls down for my mind is in the facilities especially for food and drink the lodge seems to suit the caravanning crowd but not the cabin accommodation there are no cooking facilities in the rooms not even a microwave this then makes you have to use the lodges meal facilities these are only open at certain times and is all al a carte dinner and breakfast are fine but outside these times you can only purchase snacks form the shop there is plenty to purchase if you were camping but not much if you cannot cookreheat etc the idea of having a buffet lunch was awesome until we found out it was only for the tourist bus groups and after being rudely pushed out of the way by some seemingly very hungry individuals of said group we gave up and fed on snacks it just seems to me that we are being pushed to use the bistrobar to eat as nothing else is available

"We stayed one night in Cooinda Lodge Kakadu to take advantage of the Yellow Water Cruise and Warradja Visitor Centres. Check-in was alright and quick. We were not able to find a parking lot in the designated area, so we had to circle a few times around the property in order to find a lot which was in the opposite side and not too far away. There were many water bugs flying around in the open-air restaurant and around our property, which freaked the kids out. Room was otherwise comfortable and clean and the bed was decent. Presence of a showerhead in the bathroom instead of only a rain shower would help those who have to clean their kids up. The minimart is well stocked. Overall the prices are that of a 5 star premium accommodation and if it could be around the AUD250-280 range I think that would be more reasonable, considering no breakfast included, etc.",3.0,Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,we stayed one night in cooinda lodge kakadu to take advantage of the yellow water cruise and warradja visitor centres checkin was alright and quick we were not able to find a parking lot in the designated area so we had to circle a few times around the property in order to find a lot which was in the opposite side and not too far away there were many water bugs flying around in the openair restaurant and around our property which freaked the kids out room was otherwise comfortable and clean and the bed was decent presence of a showerhead in the bathroom instead of only a rain shower would help those who have to clean their kids up the minimart is well stocked overall the prices are that of a star premium accommodation and if it could be around the aud range i think that would be more reasonable considering no breakfast included etc

"We loved our stay at Cooinda. Our little glamping tent was super cute, the pools were fantastic and the service at the restaurant was excellent. And our morning cruise with Chrissie and Dennis was a real highlight. But I have to agree with some of the earlier reviews on cleaning. The shower blocks were riddled with black and red mould.. the morning cleaner would literally just mop around it. The drains were all blocked too, so water was just swirling and pooling from the showers on either side.. it was really unpleasant. We didn't even want to put our toddler down to stand on the floor in there. Some deep cleaning is well overdue. And while we were staying there, one of the lodge rooms across from us sat for 2 DAYS with leftover room service food all over the outside table — burgers, chips, pizza — smashed glasses on the ground and the sliding door just sitting wide open.

"We recently stayed at the Mercure Crocodile, Kakadu for 2 nights. From this point forward, we will refer to this as the Meh-cure.
We are a family of 3 - and Accor members - and thought that although the Meh-cure was expensive (and yes, I realise July is peak season) that this would be an ideal choice for us  as a base to explore Kakadu.
Check in was good and the reception staff were lovely but sadly, that’s about the only positive I’ve got. The ‘resort’ and is use that term loosely is tired and in desperate need of a face lift. The grounds inside near the pool are woefully in need of a refresh. The landscaping and dying plants look sad. The stairs, the handrails and the walkways all need a good clean.
The room was probably fine in 1992 but not so much now. The bathroom and ‘kitchen’ are beyond worn and dated and things like the windowsill covered in dead flies is just not what you’d expect for the room rate.
Most disappointing of all was the food option. We booked to enjoy dinner at the restaurant but sadly our best option was a $55 per head buffet as we were advised that al a Carte selections would be a 45 minute wait. The food was ok but on leaving we were advised that Sunday dinner incurs a 15% surcharge (there was a sign advising this hidden behind a pot plant). It was a bit rich to fork out $200+ for a pretty average dinner.
The Meh-cure was just pretty meh really.

We booked a superior twin room, it was rather compact and a little dated

I also didn’t find the gardens set out well for guests, not much under cover for the 35 degree days

"Overhyped and mainly for kids, attractions are standard and very basic. The croc feeding is comedic at best. You can certainly hold the baby crocs, but the picture is $35.

"It was a good experience, however it felt a little disjointed and found myself looking for things to do between shows. I enjoyed the reptile enclosure, some awesome specimens. It was great to see these big salties up close. Check out the website and plan your visit around the shows.

"To be honest I was a disappointed. The tankes these big crocs are kept in are tiny. The cage of death I thought was a fizzler, the Crocs seemed so lethargic and disinterested. They needed so much encouragement to go after the food. The fish feeding didn't happen as none of the fish showed any interest. The highlight for my grandson was to feed a baby croc and to hold one. We did the Adelaide River Jumping Croc Cruise and that was hands down a better experience interacting with Crocs seeing them in their natural environment.",3.0,Crocosaurus Cove,to be honest i was a disappointed the tankes these big crocs are kept in are tiny the cage of death i thought was a fizzler the crocs seemed so lethargic and disinterested they needed so much encouragement to go after the food the fish feeding didnt happen as none of the fish showed any interest the highlight for my grandson was to feed a baby croc and to hold one we did the adelaide river jumping croc cruise and that was hands down a better experience interacting with crocs seeing them in their natural environment

The negative is that there is very little to do here. You can go through the whole place in about 30 minutes. The different shows are spaced very far apart so unless you want to spend the whole day here, you can't really see all the shows.

"Beautiful national park. I especially enjoyed Ubirr which (if you climb it) had one of the most spectacular views I have seen in my life. The rock art is also very fascinating, and it’s nice that there are information-boards so you know what you are looking at. The downside of the national park is that it in the evening is a literal mosquito hell during the beginning of the dry season (May-June when we were there). From sunset to sunrise it is basically impossible to be or move outside without being attacked and completely covered in mosquitoes.

The trip is interesting and the guide was excellent - but you can only really visit a couple of easily accessible sites once there.
It was also the start of the wet - so we got rained on and then delayed 5 hours at a roadhouse on return due to flooded roads and fallen trees.. The company provided free food and drinks until a 4WD truck could come get us. It was quite the adventure and no fault of the company who were fabulous in handling the situation.

"Came to collect endangered animals, stayed for the nice views. Word on the town was that the near-extinct Palos Verdes Blue Butterfly was flying in for Winter hibernation in the mangrove trees of the park. I've been in the business for a long time, so I was one of the first to capitalize on this by taking the first available flight I could find down to Kakadu International Airport.

While I only saw a few instances of the butterfly, I can definitely vouch for the incredible atmosphere and surreal vistas of the park. I would've rated this location five stars had I not collected only forty pairs of Palos Verdes wings, leading to me just barely breaking even on the cost of the flights.

Key Vacation Details
- Visited in the last week of August 2022.
- Max temperature was 36 degrees daily. The heat was the most challenging but we managed.
- Due to the heat, I recommend exploring outdoor sites in the early morning (approx 630am - 1130am) and late arvo (from 4pm)
- Flies were around, but manageable. Minimal mozzies which weren't noticeable.
- 2WD Rav4
- 4 nights, 5 days
- Split trip bw Jabiru and Cooinda
- Stocked up on a lot food, dry snacks and water at Coles near Darwin Airport. This came in handy.

"We had a fantastic stay in the glamping tent! We’d seen a few reviews mentioning that the food was overpriced, but we have to disagree — those comments felt a bit unfair in our experience. That said, we only dined at the onsite restaurant, Mini’s, and didn’t try the casual dining section, so perhaps those reviews were referring to that instead.

As for Mini’s, we can only speak highly of it. Over our two-night stay, we had some of the best meals of our entire NT trip. The service was exceptional — the staff were genuinely attentive, asked for feedback on new dishes, remembered our names, and even gave us great tips for places to visit the next day.

We tried all the available mains and loved them, especially the cauliflower, buffalo, and barramundi. Breakfast was just as impressive, with a great variety and some of the best coffee we had on the trip.

The tent itself was also fantastic. The bed was phenomenally comfortable — so much so that we even took note of the pillow brand because it was that good!

If there’s one clear area for improvement, it would be the landscaping and toilet access. We chose a tent without a private toilet, which was fine in theory, but the shared facilities were quite a walk away. There were no clear paths through the grounds, so we often found ourselves wandering around in the dark — sometimes at 1am — weaving through other tents on uneven, unpathed ground, surrounded by cane toads.

"We stayed for 4 nights in one of the motel style rooms. We had an excellent time! Our room was very clean and well maintained. The room was also quite spacious and had a patio with furniture. The only downside was the bathroom was not spacious - a smaller corner shower cubicle with rainfall shower head, although new and quite nice. I happen to have a personal loathing of rainfall shower heads as they make washing more difficult for me.
The bed was extremely comfortable and the air con was on when we arrived, which is always appreciated.

The grounds of the resort are gorgeous - and all very flat which made it much easier for this disabled traveller.

The buffet breakfast was standard stuff, but all well prepared and fresh. Extra points for having perfectly poached eggs available.

Service from everyone was friendly and attentive. We ate in both the restaurant and the bistro and both were good. It was nice to have some better salad and fresh food options after a lengthy roadtrip through the outback where I had found myself craving fresh fruit and lightly cooked vegetables instead of chips and burgers (although both of these were available and very tasty). Bistro portions were very generous. Restaurant portions were more fine dining size, but a shared entree, a main each and a shared side was enough for dinner for us - if you're hungry definitely have three courses.

We did both the sunset and dawn yellow waters cruises. Dennis and Jess were both excellent - Dennis has a fantastic, dry sense of humour and tells great stories! From a disability access perspective, they gave me a lift on the buggy to the dock which was helpful - good to know they can if anyone travelling is a bit frail. All photos attached to this review are from the cruise. It's an extra cost but a must-do and takes off right from the resort - from home dock at the resort in wet season as the main dock is underwater. In a few weeks the take off will be a short bus trip away from the resort as the water goes.

The cruise itself was spectacular - with everything still quite wet, it was just incredible to see endless waters reflecting the sky. Even though early April is still pretty quiet for wildlife, we saw saltwater crocodiles and a lovely array of bird life! I am very sure I could happily spend months out on the water watching the seasons change.

The main pool at the resort is lovely too! It has a ramp that is a bit on the step end (pool is older than current access standards), but still easier access for me than steps.

Being in Kakadu at this time of year means that we're of course in a hot, humid and remote environment. When holidaying in the area, bring lots of water, a big hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and a lot of bug spray - you may be eaten alive regardless. I saw most tourists wearing shorts sleeves - but you are actually much better off wearing long sleeves, for both sun and bug protection. Have a look at what most tour operators are wearing - long sleeve breathable fabrics like cotton are the way :)

"I really loved the convenience of Cooinda Lodge! We stayed in a lodge room. It is a teeny bit cramped for 4 people with queen and two singles (we sat around on our beds) but it's not an issue if you're out all day walking, sightseeing or in the pool. It certainly didn't bother us, and I did really like the kakadu botanicals in the bathroom!

The best part is getting to the yellow water cruises which is right outside so I don't have to drag myself at early hours in the car there.

Being close to the water you will have lots of bugs so don't leave your doors open with the lights on!

So many eating options to choose from and they aren't super cheap but I don't expect that for the middle of a national park. Fuel here as well, a store with food, camping and fishing gear.

"Part of a road trip around the top of NT was a stop in Kakadu, and specifically the massive metropolis that is Jabiru.
Now, when staying in crocodile country, what better place to stay that a building constructed in the representative manner of a crocodile.
Whilst I waited in that car, my wife ventured inside to check in. It wasn't until later that I entered the space that is the check in area, come shop, come art gallery.
Check in quick and efficient, with quick info on best coffee in town, when the supermarket is open and how much there isn't to do around what is a very small gathering of caravan parks, a petrol station, art gallery and a few other shops ( and I do mean a few). But I digress.
Car parked in one of the three round carparks (represents crocodile eggs) and a very short walk to our ground floor room. There is a first floor ( or second if you're American or cannot count properly).
All rooms open onto the central courtyard - either looking at water features or another water feature, the pool. We're poor so we were in a standard room. Yep, it was standard, with a nice supportive bed, and great pillows. Look the older and more broken you get, the more a good pillow makes up for some other deficiencies.
It's an old hotel, that has had a few updates, but look around and you'll see the age of the joint. It may be different in more expensive rooms, but it felt like a classic Ferrari - looks great from a distance, but it's worn out and needs a proper going over to sort the dodgy fixes, suss paint job and dodgy air con.
Pillows aside (have I said, they're great pillows) the rooms are big, well, mine was. The bathroom was the old hotel shower over small bath type. With the need for a plastic suction mat in the bottom of the bath ( the same sort your nan uses to prevent slippage and mass limb fractures). And because personal hygiene requires problem solving, a shower curtain that doesn't quite close the gaps up, so water goes everywhere - especially if your my wife.
The water also never really got above tepid. Which as it was bloody hot, was not a great loss. In fact, woke me up every time I had a wash.
The room was built of plain blocks over painted, well some of it. For some reason the ceiling had bubbled and blistering paint. My guess was moisture - leak or poor cooling. Which may have been a reason for a dehumidifier or similar small appliance that was plugged in and rattling away whilst we stayed. At least it would have done so, if it didn't break down with flashing icons all over its control pad.
And whilst we're looking up, there's a fan/light contraption that is not centrally located and works off a seperate remote to all other light controls. Feels like an addition done cheaply to help the air con, which struggled. God knows what it's like in the wet season?
Plenty of power points, unlike some of the other abodes we stayed in.
Sometimes, there's a ""what the"" moment when your on holiday, and this was when I went to the patio doors. Locked with a flip lock, then added safety chain, and a large sign that advises/tells you to keep doors locked at all times. Very reassuring to know that it's more dangerous than a walking holiday through Mexican border towns. Feels like a bit of a theme in areas travelled to in the region.
Now, by reading the above you'd think I was down on the croc hotel. Nope, forget the paint, rotten skirting boards and zombie proof doors, it's a good place to stay.
The restaurant was visited on one night, and although I'd read some reviews saying the buffet was awful, we choose it. Can't be certain, but it's offered when large tour groups book in.
All the food was good, with the curry being an absolute stunner. As it's a buffet, you can gorge yourself until you can't stuff in anymore. I didn't rate the desserts though - bit sweet and a bit samey for my tastes.
To make life just a little more relaxed, I had a cocktail - again Long Island Iced Tea wins value for money.

"Obviously, this hotel is all about the shape and it works quite well, although you would need to view it from the air to see it properly.

Our room was very spacious with an additional seating area with a table and chairs, which could be used for dining at if you wanted to bring food in from elsewhere (there is a supermarket just a short walk from the hotel).

// Back at the market before leaving Darwin tomorrow. We got there around 6 pm and spent about 20 minutes finding a parking spot—definitely come early if you’re driving!

The Sunday crowd was much bigger compared to Thursday when we first visited. Tried the pork stick (AUD 6) after a long queue—super fatty, juicy, and very salty..

Also grabbed the garlic butter corn cob (AUD 9), and it was amazing! The vendor asked if we wanted salt, I said no, and it was still delicious. Highly recommend eating the corn while it’s hot!

// Came to the market around 4+ and it was already crowded. There’s a wide variety of food — from Chinese to Thai, Mexican, Japanese, Korean and more. We settled for a kebab and a bowl of chicken laksa.

The kebab was really good at AUD15. The flatbread was crispy, generously filled with chicken, and the mix of ingredients inside made it delicious.

The chicken laksa was less impressive. Coming from Singapore, I found it weak in flavor compared to our spicier version. The Darwin version was sweeter, with a strong coconut taste. It had so much chicken that I could hardly find the noodles.

For dessert, I tried the churros in the “must-try” Lotus flavor. It didn’t seem freshly made and wasn’t as crispy as expected. Lotus is definitely sweet — I probably clocked my sugar intake for the whole year with that dessert.

As for picking the right food stall - the queues are the indicator . I had seafood paella which was not bad & huge qty for $23. There's Mexican, Italian, fish + chips etc as well as the many Asian street food to pick from. The sorbet & ice-cream stalls are  - pick the smaller one with a youngish girl - 3 fresh flavours for $7.

I found my halcyon quietude on the beach before sunset at 6.30 pm on Thurs 24/7 recently - the crowds were there around me but hey! Be in the moment & block it out. Left the company of my friends to enjoy the vivid hues of NT sunset alone on the warm sand, hoping that a carelessly discarded fork won't stab me! Let alone some random croc or stingers as the sign on beach warns..lol..Toilets are on either end of market. Onsite parking but public transport is best.

"This place is pretty amazing set over 3 levels right in the heart of Darwin CBD.
Lost a star because the aquarium with fish, turtles and Sting rays could be .... cleaner? Brighter? It's pretty dark and I'm not sure what can be done with that. It's the first exhibit you come across and it should be more of a WoW factor.
The crocs are *huge*, the ""cage of death"" looks fun (if the croc doesn't move in the enclosure they will move you around to another pen. 'Will' was the winner for today and put on a good. Cage of Death has a time frame of 15mins for $195 (single occupant).
The reptile house is amazing and when we walked through there was lovely young Lady with a snake and Blue Tounge Lizard ""Steven"" that you can hold. These guys are really chilled and there were a few younger kids before us that got to hold them, and waved them through the air and chased their siblings around with them and they didn't seemed phased.
Take your bathers, there's a little swimming pool you can take a dip in - the lost star includes this pool - it was filled with leaves and a bit neglected. Could do with a clean as you kick up the silt on the bottom and can't get a good photo of the crocs 'swimming' beside you (swimming with the crocs ).

"We had a wonderful time at this delightful place! The environment was fun, and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. We even got the unique opportunity to hold a crocodile and a snake, and fed the crocs—definitely memorable moments during our stay in Darwin.

However, there was a bit of affecting the mood with one of the staff members who kept reminding us not to photograph the participants diving with the ""Cage of Death"" crocs. Respecting her wishes, I focused my photos on the crocodiles themselves and carefully avoiding the participants. Despite this, two staff members stand close to me, staring at me and discussing something like, ""I have told him!"" in a manner that felt somewhat dismissive.

I understand the importance of their guidelines and although I am a tourist I understand English well and knew that they were discussing me indeed.  I have thought of  showing them my photos to demonstrate my compliance... ultimately, I chose not to.

"Kakadu National Park is a protected area in the Northern Territory of Australia, 171 km (106 mi) southeast of Darwin. It is a World Heritage Site. Kakadu is also gazetted as a locality, covering the same area as the national park, with 313 people recorded living there in the 2016 Australian census.

Kakadu National Park is located within the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory, covering an area of 19,804 km2 (7,646 sq mi), extending nearly 200 kilometres (124 mi) from north to south and over 100 kilometres (62 mi) from east to west. It is roughly the size of Wales or one-third the size of Tasmania, and is the second-largest national park in Australia, after the Munga-Thirri–Simpson Desert National Park. Most of the region is owned by the Aboriginal traditional owners, who have occupied the land for around 60,000 years and, today, manage the park jointly with Parks Australia. It is highly ecologically and biologically diverse, hosting a wide range of habitats and flora and fauna. It also includes a rich heritage of Aboriginal rock art, including highly significant sites, such as Ubirr. Kakadu is fully protected by the EPBC Act.

Kakadu is a place of enormous ecological and biological diversity. It extends from the coast and estuaries in the north through floodplains, billabongs and lowlands to rocky ridges and stone country in the south. These landscapes are home to a range of rare and endemic plants and animals, including more than one-third of Australia's bird species and one-quarter of its freshwater and estuarine fish species.️

"Whatever you do, and no matter how many days you stay in Kakadu National Park, get ready to be amazed! It's definitely one of the most beautiful national parks I have visited in my life. It's not only the biggest territorial park in the country, but it's also listed for both cultural and natural values at the UNESCO, for more than valid reasons!
1. There are so many different kinds of landscapes you can see here, with peaceful wildlife (birds, mammals, reptiles, everything!). It's tough to stop taking photos to just peaceful enjoy the privilege of being there!
2. First nations individuals and Australian governments are actively collaborating together in a Board to protect the park in the best way possible, using traditional and modern methods.
3. The best part for history and culture enthusiasts like me is that we can visit some of the first nations' caves to see fascinating rock art paintings and old ceremony sites. We can not access so much as some sites are still being used, but that's enough to give insights and teach us a lot. For this part, it is definitely better to get a local guide to have the best explanations possible.
To be fair, I visited Nourlangie (actually Burrunggui is the right name) with a mixed Caucasian/first nations guide and with a 100% Caucasian guide, and the first one provided way more insight and stories than the second (first hand experience can never be replaced, no matter how many books someone may read). I highly recommend getting a proper local guide if you can choose.

In April, Ubirr site was sadly not accessible, but the yellow water were still high and covered by water lilies. We can't get everything I guess and that made me feel that this park deserves to be visited during different seasons (they count 6 seasons there, if I remember properly).

We visited 2 cultural centers that complete each other, but if you have time for one only then Warandjan cultural center is the best (more comprehensive and better maintained with a big shop) than the Bowali center.

In any case, don't forget to pay the fee before you enter the park and ENJOY this magical place!",5.0,Kakadu National Park,whatever you do and no matter how many days you stay in kakadu national park get ready to be amazed its definitely one of the most beautiful national parks i have visited in my life its not only the biggest territorial park in the country but its also listed for both cultural and natural values at the unesco for more than valid reasons there are so many different kinds of landscapes you can see here with peaceful wildlife birds mammals reptiles everything its tough to stop taking photos to just peaceful enjoy the privilege of being there first nations individuals and australian governments are actively collaborating together in a board to protect the park in the best way possible using traditional and modern methods the best part for history and culture enthusiasts like me is that we can visit some of the first nations caves to see fascinating rock art paintings and old ceremony sites we can not access so much as some sites are still being used but thats enough to give insights and teach us a lot for this part it is definitely better to get a local guide to have the best explanations possible to be fair i visited nourlangie actually burrunggui is the right name with a mixed caucasianfirst nations guide and with a caucasian guide and the first one provided way more insight and stories than the second first hand experience can never be replaced no matter how many books someone may read i highly recommend getting a proper local guide if you can choose in april ubirr site was sadly not accessible but the yellow water were still high and covered by water lilies we cant get everything i guess and that made me feel that this park deserves to be visited during different seasons they count seasons there if i remember properly we visited cultural centers that complete each other but if you have time for one only then warandjan cultural center is the best more comprehensive and better maintained with a big shop than the bowali center in any case dont forget to pay the fee before you enter the park and enjoy this magical place

"Litchfield National Park, covering approximately 1500 km2, is near the township of Batchelor, 100 km south-west of Darwin, in the Northern Territory of Australia. Each year the park attracts over 260,000 visitors.

Proclaimed a national park in 1986, it is named after Frederick Henry Litchfield, a Territory pioneer, who explored areas of the Northern Territory from Escape Cliffs in Van Diemen Gulf to the Daly River in 1864.

This park is home to stunning and idyllic waterfalls, places to swim and stay, 4WD tracks, scenic walks and hidden natural wonders which is a true wonder of the Top End.️

"A great day trip. Accessible from Darwin ~1.5h. Arguably better and more accessible than Kakadu with a lot of swimming holes and day tracks. Open 24/7. Worth visiting as there are not many day trip destinations around Darwin.
A loop from Darwin- Batchelor - Litchfield - Berry springs - Darwin ia about 300km. Spend about 6-10 hours there to enjoy 3-4 spots. Can easily start from Darwin at around 6am and back to Darwin at 4pm.
2WD accessible along the main road, 4WD for some places but to explore both, you'd need at least 2 days.
⛽No fuel station inside the park, closest one is in Batchelor. Best to fill before leaving Darwin.
️ Popular spots: Wangi Fall, Florence Fall. (Best to check the reviews on specific area for more information)
‍♀️Day walk: Each spot offers ~1-3km day walk with moderate difficulty. For a day trip focusing on bush walking, it's possible to do 3-4 walks during the day. There are about 7 day walk along the main road. From my favourite to my least favourite: Wangi fall loop, Florence shady creek, Tolmer loop, Walker creek to the campsite and back, Upper Cascade, Florence to Buley, Greenants.
Overnight walk: Tabletop track, 39km multiple day hike, book online and extra preparation needed.
♿ Wheelchair friendly access includes Wangi fall and Tolmer fall (lookout point only). Some picnic area are wheelchair accessible from the car parks (such as Greenant, Walker, Buley rockhole) but mostly aren't designed for wheelchair access in mind.
‍♂️ There are so many pools. They can be very crowded. Best to come early in the morning. Pools are deep, but no current. Save for swimmers, if you are not confident, please bring inflatable noodles. Check if the swimming spots are open on the website (some are closed during wet/ early dry season due to croc risks).
Toilet + toilet paper + non potable water is normally available around car parks, but bring your own handwashing liquid.
No signal, download offline map, but you won't get lost as there is only 1 road in and out of Litchfield, there are signages around.
Bring your own food and drinking water. The only food stall is at Wangi fall, or in Batchelor town and some caravan parks between Batchelor and Litchfield.
 No rubbish bin inside the national park, carry your own rubbish bin and bring it back home.
Park is free for NT residents, interstate/ international visitors must prucase a park pass. You can only get your parks pass online. Do this before you go, no signal inside the park.
✅to bring for a day trip: swimming suit, goggles, towel, hat, sunscreen, esky, at least 2L water/person, food, hand sanitizer.

"The drive to Litchfield National Park's first waterfall (Wangi Falls) is about 1.5 hrs from Darwin city centre.

The waterfall is about a flat 5 minute walk from the carpark. Two waterfalls and nice swim. Has toilet facilities but no toilet paper ... also a cafeteria onsite.

The next one we visited was Tolma Falls. You can only view it from a platform and its about 15 min walk down hill but bring water as uphill walk back to car gets very hot.

The falls we enjoyed the most is Florence waterfalls.
The plunge pool is awesome

There is 2 different ways to access it. Suggest go down to the falls via stairs as its a steeper decline and walk back via the track on.way back to car. Takes about 30 each way.

2 waterfalls.
Gorgeous swim and so clear. Near the rocky shallow part u do get fish that nibble at your feet.

Suggest to bring
1. a swimming noodle to swim out to where the falls enter the lagoon.
2. Small umbrellas on days expecting rain especially if you are with a baby or wanting to protect your belongings like electronic devices

"Cooinda Lodge is part of the Accor Group, so was able to access my member discount/upgrade. With that in mind, we booked one of their Yellow Water Villas for four nights and were so glad we did. The villas take glamping to a new level. Elevated on stilts, you are completely immersed in the surrounding bush, overlooking the Yellow Water billabong. Our villa, ""Barramundi"", was so luxurious, spacious, filled with light and extra features. It was like a five-star hotel room with an outlook that can't be beaten. It even had an outdoor bathtub on the deck.

The staff at the lodge were extremely helpful. The breakfast, which was included, at Mimi's Restaurant was really good - plenty of choices, freshly brewed coffee and squeezed juices. We spent so much time trekking around Kakadu then we didn't get much time to appreciate all the features at the lodge, however we did get the opportunity to watch the footy on the big screen whilst have dinner at the Barra Bar.

Perfect location to take advantage of the sunrise and sunset Yellow Water Cruises, as the bus picked us up from a stop in front of the main reception.

"Cooinda lodge @ Kakadu is the best!!! - it’s the first stop of our 2-week Australia trip. Our 3-night stay from check-in at reception to booking cruise tour to check out were seamless and exceptional. Staff were really helpful, rooms are clean, and the food quality blew our socks off.

we booked the breakfast package and it exceeded our expectations - the fresh orange juice and DIY fresh veggies (beets, ginger, carrots, cucumber) juice station were amazing. we ate dinner at the lodge every night - we loved the kangaroo steak, pizza, fish curry and linguini. So delicious. The drinks are great also.

Location is perfect for day trips drive to see nearby sites; it’s also easy to spend the day at the lodge; the cultural center is a short walk away.

Overall, a spectacular stay!

"We stayed in the glamping tent with shared amenities - gorgeous tent, air conditioned if you need it, fan, fridge, mains power, big king bed (European style - two king singles pushed together), big verandah - just superb and set in gorgeous shady grounds where it felt very private despite the tents all around.

"Amazing place! Make an excuse to go here! I went during the end of wet season (big difference in the place in different seasons). Food was splendid with loads to choose and they changed the ingredients in one thing I tried which was brilliant! Accessibility was ok with a regular step to get into the regular Lodge room. Back door was a wide veranda sliding door which was pretty flat. Spotless rooms! Aircon worked great! Plenty of plug sockets in good place. No wifi in the Lodge rooms. Rainfall shower head only. Bit of a walk to the parking areas across grass, and they seemed to fill fast without assigned parking, but if you need help getting about they have a small golf cart, although that has a huge step to get up. Pool had a nice ramp leading down into it, no railing though and with a small step on the edge of the pool. Staff were amazing! Very happy to help in any way possible! I was made to feel very welcome. On site attractions are well worth doing. Small shop at reception has loads of essential items and fuel. 60km drive to closest town of Jabiru.

The jumping pillow, playground were also a hit with the kids. The camp kitchen is minimal but enough. If you want the full resort experience that is available to you. Great grounds and atmosphere.

We had one night in Jabiru which was our last night in Kakadu.  I found the hotel really lovely - the front desk team were very warm and welcoming.  The restaurant meals (Dinner & Breakfast) were fantastic - way beyond my expectations.  I shared a room with a friend and we had 2 double beds -  I was surprised how much room we had. The room had sliding doors opening out onto the grass which gave a nice open feel to the room.  (And thank you for the hairdryer in the room - it's the little things :-) ) I also loved the Indigenous art everywhere.

The only downside was that we have to climb up steps (architecturally the crocodile legs) with our luggages and 1 + 5 years olds.

For the price we are paying in such a hard-to-access location, the room is considered cosy and the amenities are great. Like most top end hotels, bring your own toothbrush and toothpaste.

The staff are warm, helpful, and genuinely passionate about sharing their knowledge of the local Aboriginal culture, which made the experience even more meaningful.

One hidden gem is the art gallery and shop in the lobby—it's seriously underrated. It showcases a range of artworks by Aboriginal artists, many of which are available at very reasonable prices. I highly recommend setting aside time to explore—it feels like a treasure hunt with the added reward of supporting the local community.

"Darwin locals decided to do a staycation at the Crocodile Hotel. We spent 2 fabulous nights there and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. Rooms were nice, pool incredible & shaded so great temp in the wet season. We paid for the breakfast to be included and were glad we did. During the wet breakfast is off the alacart menu. The staff were AMAZING!! We stayed from the 23-25th of the December and there was nothing the staff wouldn't do for our family. Extremely child friendly.

"Why don't I have any photos of this wonderful hotel? We were having just too good a time.

This hotel is in the heart of the Kakadu National Park. Make sure you have the permits you need to travel and refuel in and out of this area as access is restricted.

That said, once here, this hotel has the most lovely, attentive staff in reception and everywhere. Nothing was too much trouble, if they didn't have something to hand, they knew who did and got right on the phone.

The menu in the restaurant is not extensive, but the choice is wide enough that there is something for everyone, and what they do have is cooked to perfection. I had Kangaroo loin like I have never ad it before, slightly smoked and a joy to the palate.

Lots of nice cold beer and wine, and a buffer breakfast with all the vest and fresh you could want.

There's a lovely pool, plentiful indigenous arts and craft on display and for sale, and a pleasant gift shop with some items at prices significantly lower than in the ""big smoke."". I paid $55 for an indigenous shirt that was being sold in Darwin for 90.

Plenty of opportunities for walks, lookouts, river cruises and local attractions within an easy 30 minute drive

"Without a doubt, the best location to stay in Darwin!
My experience at Mindil Beach Casino Resort was absolutely outstanding from start to finish. I received a warm and welcoming reception upon arrival, and was even able to check in a little early – a much appreciated gesture after a long day of travel.

My room was beautiful: spacious, tastefully decorated, and with a breathtaking view of the ocean. Everything was spotlessly clean and the entire hotel smells wonderfully fresh. You can truly feel the care and attention that goes into every detail here.

The facilities are fantastic – two stunning swimming pools (one with a view of the sea), direct beach access within walking distance, and a range of high-quality restaurants that serve delicious food. Dining here is a real treat!

Perfect location, right next to the Mindil Market as well.

What truly makes this resort stand out is the exceptional service. The staff are warm, professional, and quick to assist with anything you might need. A special shout-out to Sreena Amir and Kellie who went above and beyond to make my stay feel extra special – thank you for your kindness and hospitality!

If I had to mention one small point for improvement: there are no power outlets directly next to the bed, which made charging my phone slightly inconvenient. But honestly, that’s the only minor detail in what was otherwise a flawless experience.

There’s a huge variety of food stalls offering global cuisines — from American and Southern European to Southeast Asian and classic Aussie — alongside quirky arts and crafts, all run by local vendors. Supporting NT small businesses made the experience even more meaningful.

Live music and whip-cracking demonstrations added to the entertainment, and for something a little different, camel rides along the beach are also available. Facilities were thoughtfully laid out, with toilets at both ends, portable ATMs, and plenty of parking (we Ubered there with no trouble at all).

"I always visit the Mindil Beach Sunset Markets while I am in Darwin,  as it is always a highlight for me:) The markets run every Thursday and Sunday from 4 pm to 9 pm, during the dry season which is late April through to late October.

It does get extremely busy, so the crowds might not be for everyone. But the main attraction is the sunset. The view from Mindil Beach is pretty special; The sun looks bigger here as it sets right over the Arafura sea and you get that uninterrupted horizon. It’s one of those sunsets that really stops you in your tracks. Everyone claps when it is over because it is spectacular!

There’s a great mix of street food stalls, local arts and crafts, and live music. I even saw people doing camel rides along the beach as the sun was coming down.

Something to note – you can’t bring dogs into the market area, unless it’s a certified assistance dog. It’s a bit of a shame if you’re travelling with your pet, but good to know before you go.

"We visited in mid July, where the temperatures are @ 30 degrees celcius during the day. Mindil Beach Market is held 4pm-9pm on Thur's & Sun's. From Darwin CBD, it's 5min drive or 10min by bus No.4 from outside Woolworths Cavendagh. Wear hat & bring a water bottle, as there's not a lot of shade. Wear comfy shoes as short walk to from bus to market (6min / 200m on fairly flat ground), but careful of white shoes, as carpark is red dirt. Heat drops down after sunset. Bring handwipes/serviettes/hand sanitiser if you like to stay clean & fresh as theres lots of people & lots of yummy food trucks. Lines for food can be a bit long, but so worth it. Be aware- most of the food vendors DON'T sell drinks, however there are many vendors selling different types of fresh drinks, like tropical juices etc. We had the famous Croc burger, the patty has fresh mango & sweet chilli- amazing, & the chips that were an optional side were delicious & a generous portion. We also tried the BBQ prawns on skewers- yum!! Constant fresh supply being brought out to serve. The market stalls- so much jewelry,  lots of freshwater pearls.

"During the dry season, this market opens twice a week. There are many food options here, and my favorite is a small seafood stall with a blue tent, selling cooked lobster, mud crab, octopus, large prawns, and oysters. I’ve been here several times and tried them all—they're all fresh and delicious. Afterward, I head to a fresh juice stall for a cup of mixed juice or fruit tea. Finally, I go to a fruit stall to buy some freshly peeled jackfruit as dessert. For me, that’s a perfect dinner. As the sky gradually darkens and turns pink, I watch the beautiful sunset on the beach. There’s a special tradition here: when the sun finally dips below the horizon, everyone cheers and claps, celebrating the end of the hot day and the arrival of the cool, comfortable evening. This night market also has many stalls selling local handicrafts, Aboriginal artwork, musical instruments, and small accessories, which are nice to browse through. There’s a live performance area, where you can sit down to enjoy the show while eating.

"Crocosaurus Cove – A Must-Do in Darwin
Crocosaurus Cove is an absolute must-do if you’re visiting Darwin! At first, I couldn’t book a ticket online and thought it might be closed, but it turns out there was just a problem with their booking system. They are open every day, and I’m so glad we went.

The staff are extremely knowledgeable and friendly, making the whole experience unforgettable. From start to finish, it was an incredible way to get up close to some of the most fascinating wildlife in the Top End.

The camping facilities were great and all of the amenities also great. With camping there are outdoor bbqs and covered areas. In the night we were visited by some brumbies (2 adults and a foal).

"Great place from which to visit Kakadu. Food was excellent and the service was very friendly and generally good. Facilities clean and comfortable. The food was excellent, although the breakfast was a bit short staffed, so our salt and pepper pots were empty, and I missed out on bacon because the batch wasn't refilled for 20 minutes. I imagine due to being a bit short-staffed at the time of year. However, all the staff were very friendly and helpful.",,Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,great place from which to visit kakadu food was excellent and the service was very friendly and generally good facilities clean and comfortable the food was excellent although the breakfast was a bit short staffed so our salt and pepper pots were empty and i missed out on bacon because the batch wasnt refilled for minutes i imagine due to being a bit shortstaffed at the time of year however all the staff were very friendly and helpful

"Positives: Service was excellent (front of house, dining). Mattress and bedding were comfortable and sleep came easily.

Negatives: The facility does not have a lift, requiring 20kg suitcases to be taken up stairs to the second floor.

This is a pretty tired hotel in need of an upgrade. Rooms are basic and seem to have been temporarily and continually patched up. Food was either a canteen level buffet or not that great a la carte. The hotel seems to cater for large numbers of tourists on coach tours rather than individuals. That being said there is nowhere else to stay other than a caravan park and you don't go to Kakadu for the accommodation and fine dining. The tours (they were not run by the hotel) were fine and interesting. Bottom line is that if you are staying at Kakadu this is the only hotel but don't expect too much.,,Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,this is a pretty tired hotel in need of an upgrade rooms are basic and seem to have been temporarily and continually patched up food was either a canteen level buffet or not that great a la carte the hotel seems to cater for large numbers of tourists on coach tours rather than individuals that being said there is nowhere else to stay other than a caravan park and you dont go to kakadu for the accommodation and fine dining the tours they were not run by the hotel were fine and interesting bottom line is that if you are staying at kakadu this is the only hotel but dont expect too much
Great place. Not sure where else you can stay in a crocodile shaped hotel. Great location for park access don’t miss Jim Jim Falls and Arnhem land tours or self drive if you have good 4wd. Restaurant is great but avoid the Kangaroo steak as the flies go crazy for it and swarm even inside as they’re trained for thousands of years to go for the kangaroo meat smell. Clothes washing really cheap only $4.50 a wash load in hotel laundromat. Pool really nice. Prices on indigenous art competitive.

"As a couple we booked a queen courtyard room, only to be given a twin-bed double room on arrival due a room issue.

"We stayed here for one night as part of a three day ATT Kings tour to Kakadu and Nitmiluk National Parks, so I cannot comment on the value for money but I am guessing it’s not going to be cheap in high season, as it is virtually the only show in town as hotels go in Kakadu, and the crocodile design is funky but reduces the number of rooms to around 120 I believe, so it is well over subscribed and was full to bursting on the night we were in.|Yes, the rooms are dated, especially the bathroom, where the fittings are from the 1970’s, but the water pressure and temperature were both excellent and the whole bathroom was clean and white, very very white.|The bedroom was spacious with two comfortable queen beds and room for a table and two chairs by the window.|The public areas including the restaurant are a lot more modern in appearance and the front lobby and associated corridor is done out more like a gallery for aboriginal art.|There are no other restaurant options in Jabiru so eating in the hotel it is. We had a buffet lunch in the hotel and if I had a complaint, it was that the evening menu was dominated by another buffet at $55 per person and there wasn’t a lot of choice outside of that. It was disappointing to find no small plate menu available from the bar and even going to the restaurant just for starters from the a la carte menu wasn’t an option as the wait times quoted were inhibitive, as the hotel clearly only wanted to be bothered by serving the buffet. |The hotel location is isolated, just as Jabiru is, so you would think very quiet. So, I was initially confused to why the hotel provides ear plugs by your bed. The insulation seemed adequate, and we didn’t get any noise bleed through from the room above or beside us. However the front door of the room faces forward into the bush, and it all became clear as the sun came up. Let’s just say the dawn chorus provided by the parrots and parakeets who came to wake up in the trees outside the hotel rooms was one of the most spectacular natures sounds I have ever had the pleasure to hear.

"This hotel is AWFUL.  We spent the night here after debarking from the fabulous Ghan train and arrived around 8PM.  The hotel looks like a 1950's Russian Gulag on the inside complete with cinder block walls, echoing central atrium and bizarrely furnished rooms.  However the worst feature is the service and planning.  We immediately went to bed on arrival in preparation for our 4:15 AM departure the next day.
