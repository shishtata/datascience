We went in the dry season on the 28th of June 2024 and all the falls were closed. On the website it was announced that the Jim Jim Falls would open that day at 4pm alongside the campground Garnamarr unpaved road and for this reason we still decided to go. As per the website the road signs stopped having the closed stickers at 4pm and so we went to Jim Jim Falls, the first 50km of the road until the campground were open, but we were met with a rude female campsite manager when we got to the entry of the road between the campsite and Jim Jim Falls (last 5km) who said it was because ""it was the rule to open the next day"", when in reality the official rules both at the website and at the road signs were that it should be open!

Our room's fan didn't work, and even though we booked for three people, there were only two coffee mugs provided. Two of the restaurant staff came across as rude and unwelcoming. Even though we booked, the guy at the restaurant desk on arrival seemed so bothered by our presence. We had to eat from the buffet because the guy said the kitchen closes in 3 minutes, so we didn't really have an option. The food was average at best. The waitress accidentally smashed a wine glass on our table, which damaged my mum's bag. While they did apologise, their attitude felt dismissive.

29,Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,1.0,"STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!

I am writing to express my concerns regarding our current stay at your hotel in Room 112.

Upon entering the room, we noticed black mold on the ceiling, which raised immediate health and safety concerns. While we understand that issues like these can sometimes arise, we would have expected them to be addressed promptly for the safety and comfort of guests. We did not feel comfortable staying in a room with visible mold, and this significantly impacted our experience.

Additionally, during our stay, we encountered an issue with the Wi-Fi, which was not functional. When we raised this concern with the front desk, the response we received was dismissive, with the staff member implying that this was expected because we were in a remote area. Furthermore, another guest also dismissed our concerns, making us feel that our complaints were not taken seriously.

As a result, we felt that our experience was far below the standard that we expected from your establishment, particularly in terms of guest service and room conditions.

32,Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,1.0,"Hotel lobby is beautiful and spacious. But during my stay, AC is not cold and had to slept throughout the night sweating. I did reported this to the hotel, the maintenance came and said there’s nothing much he can do as the AC temperature is a locked setting. However he keeps wanting to come back and check on temperature although there’s nothing he can do about the AC and kept disturbing my rest. I did have Do Not Disturb Sign on the door but he kept ignoring it. I have informed reception staff that since I am only staying for 2 nights, i dont need him to keep coming to check AC temperature, especially when he can’t do anything about it. But again, he ignored the do not disturb sign and knocked on my door when I was sleeping. I think it’s common courtesy not to knock if guest has a do not disturb sign on the door. Clearly this hotel has lack of communication among staff members.

34,Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,1.0,"Thank you for the opportunity to review our stay.

We have travelled extensively both domestically and internationally and I must say our experience at Kakadu Crocodile Hotel was not a highlight.

Whilst the staff are great and the novel design concept sort of works the rooms are so outdated it is pathetic.

We had to ask for an additional chair as we only had the beds as a sitting option for 2 people.

No lounge chairs in the room and there is room for them.

Shower over bath – really ! Shower rose leaked badly.

NO lift – we were on the 1st floor and had to manage everything up the stairs.

No ceiling fan in the NT – it’s the ONLY place we stayed at that didn’t have one.

Size of fridge was hopeless for us to store our perishable supplies – the bar did give us extra ice for the esky which helped.

We didn’t eat there as the lady on reception recommended somewhere else…… which worked out great.

I would rate the accommodation at 2 stars.

Value for money  1 star.

I am already telling everyone I know not to stay at Kakadu Crocodile Hotel.",thank you for the opportunity to review our stay we have travelled extensively both domestically and internationally and i must say our experience at kakadu crocodile hotel was not a highlight whilst the staff are great and the novel design concept sort of works the rooms are so outdated it is pathetic we had to ask for an additional chair as we only had the beds as a sitting option for people no lounge chairs in the room and there is room for them shower over bath really shower rose leaked badly no lift we were on the st floor and had to manage everything up the stairs no ceiling fan in the nt its the only place we stayed at that didnt have one size of fridge was hopeless for us to store our perishable supplies the bar did give us extra ice for the esky which helped we didnt eat there as the lady on reception recommended somewhere else which worked out great i would rate the accommodation at stars value for money star i am already telling everyone i know not to stay at kakadu crocodile hotel,thank you for the opportunity to review our stay we have travel extensively both domestically and internationally and i must say our experience at kakadu crocodile hotel be not a highlight whilst the staff be great and the novel design concept sort of work the room be so outdated it be pathetic we have to ask for an additional chair a we only have the bed a a sit option for people no lounge chair in the room and there be room for them shower over bath really shower rise leak badly no lift we be on the st floor and have to manage everything up the stair no ceiling fan in the nt it the only place we stay at that didnt have one size of fridge be hopeless for u to store our perishable supply the bar do give u extra ice for the esky which help we didnt eat there a the lady on reception recommend somewhere else which work out great i would rate the accommodation at star value for money star i be already tell everyone i know not to stay at kakadu crocodile hotel

Paid $10,000 for 2 rooms for 3 nights

The list

1 mouldy bathrooms
2 bar fridge set to freeze and froze our room service beers and my medication
3 no bottle open in room to even open beers
4 one roll of toilet paper for 3 nights
5 dirty plates left at front door after room cleaning all afternoon
6 no kettle in room
7 used microwave in room to heat water for cuppa and found a previous guests dirty cup, teabag and milk in mwo. Not sure how long it had been there, but didn’t smell great
8 leaking toilet noisy for 3 days and 3 nights
9 no evening turn down service to refresh towels used throughout the day
10 coffee shop tables where very sticky even the pepper and salt stuck to the table
11 can’t call reception after 8pm as phone didn’t work
12 pool sun lounger cushions are dirty and an eye sore to look at. I would lay on them.
13 front door entry dirty
14 rubbish in front garden for entire stay
15 outdoor shower dirty and didn’t work - tap handle fell off when we tested it.
16 furniture old and stained - even a burnt iron mark on the coffee table, amongst others

DONT EVER STAY HERE…… STAY AT VIBE AT THE DARWIN WATERFRONT …… much better location and I am sure the standards will be much higher than here - wouldn’t be hard really.

Paying super high room rates for a 5 star hotel - not sure how they got this rating….. but no more than a 3 stars in my opinion.  Extremely disappointed to say the least.

Spoke to Eddie the manager, very apologetic on the phone at the time, but nothing changed for our next 2 nights stay!!!!

41,Mindil Beach Casino Resort,1.0,"My husband and I are visitors to Australia from UK.
This afternoon we came across a semi conscious aboriginal man in a ditch near Mindil Beach. He appeared in very poor shape. Not having Australian phones we rushed to the nearest place and reported what we had seen and asked the staff at the entrance of the casino to raise some help for the man. The staff said they would draw attention of the situation to their manager. An hour later the aboriginal man was still in the same position.  I gave him some water which sadly he was in no fit condition to drink and returned to the casino to find out what action had been taken.
On speaking with the manager we were told no action had been taken. I was told the man is outside the resort grounds and not their responsibility. I understand that and was not asking them to do anything to physically help personally, merely to phone the emergency services. They refused and refused even to allow me to make a call to the emergency services from their landline saying they did not have phones.
I am astounded at the stance the manager of the casino took.
A very kind passer by eventually helped us by logging a call with emergency services so that the aboriginal man could get medical assistance. I hope it was not too late as the man was in a bad state. I do not believe his problem was alcohol related.

There was mould all through out the room. The spa bath was not working so I asked reception about it. After 5 hours and 6 employees in my room it was finally fixed. The rooms are very outdated and do not even have smart tvs so you can only choose between a few free to air channels or a movie for $15-$20.
I ordered room service and the meal was terrible, couldn’t even finish it.

I was at the crocodile leather shop making a big purchase then this extremely rude thug of a security guard came up behind me and just started demanding me and my partner to leave because of some unreasonable no dog policy , ok where are the clearly marked signs , and it’s a public place.
I was in the middle  of making a 220 dollar purchase he didn’t even want to let me finish I told that he was  harassing me and my partner, she and I felt extremely threatened , it triggered my anxiety and ptsd response..
people around me saw and heard what was happening and were disgusted by what was going on as the thug security guard was adamant on forcing my partner and I out of this public place. I said wasn’t aware of this policy and where are no dog signs and will leave after I make this purchase, he refused to be reasonable instead He continued to be threatening and unprofessional as I was trying to pay for my 220 purchase.
We started to leave and then he started following my partner and I and continued to harass us . A group of about 10 concerned bystanders saw what was going on and came up to us as support just in case the security guard got violent.
We left feeling disappointed as this was  our welcome to Darwin.
The positive was the community support that came to our defence as they all saw the disgusting behaviour of this thug of a security guard.. well done to them there is hope..and shows the community’s real voice on this situation..

We were confined to Cooinda Lodge for our trip. This was extremely expensive, we only had two options for places to eat which were at the Lodge. Rooms are very basic with nowhere to sit in your room. Everything is crazy expensive and they completely rip you off.
The current group of french backpackers working there were amazing, and the food was incredible in the bar and the restaurant. The yellow water cruise at sunset was beautiful and Chrissie who took the cruise was fun and full of local knowledge. But again it was pretty expensive.

108,Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,2.0,"The staff are kind & friendly but this is an establishment with a significant deferred maintenance problem. The rooms are grubby and rundown. Among the issues in my room alone (I didn’t venture into the outdoor areas):

- the air filter is filthy & clogged with lint (I’m sure it would contravene health regulations);
- the bathroom is tired and only superficially clean. (The bathroom should really be gutted and refitted but if there isn’t sufficient money to do that, a team of deep cleaners needs to come through the place to clean and sterilise the bathrooms from top to bottom.);
- the curtain rod has detached from the curtain, so the only way to open and close it is to grab the fabric, which adds to the grubbiness problem;
- the cushions on the lounge chairs need replacing - they have been compressed to the point that they no longer qualify as cushions;
- the fridge is old and incapable of adequate cooling (BTW, my fridge contained a water bottle with no water in it. I had to buy water from the supermarket);
- the overhead fan needs cleaning to remove the dust and lint that have accumulated, probably over years

The daily spit & polish performed by backpacker staff is obviously insufficient to deal with such issues. Nor is it an overnight fix, there is just too much to be done. What is required is a comprehensive management plan to work systematically through the deferred maintenance that has been backing up for years.

If my experience in the restaurant is anything to go by, I suspect understaffing may be partly to blame. Two or 3 pleasant but anxious young wait staff scurry about the place at buffet breakfast sittings while patrons resort to drinking hot tea out of glasses and eating cereal from plates because the cups and bowls have run out.

It pains me to record such things as I have no doubt everyone, including management, is doing their best. I suspect the fundamental problem here is declining revenue as people tighten their belts under cost of living pressures. But there’s no point gilding the lily, business as usual is no longer an option.

120,Mindil Beach Casino Resort,2.0,"I’m extremely disappointed with our recent stay in the Lagoon King Room on Friday, 21st March 2025. What should have been a relaxing family getaway to celebrate my birthday turned into a stressful and frustrating experience due to excessive noise from the neighbouring room. Between 9:00 PM and 6:00 AM, we were kept awake by loud arguments, swearing, fighting, and people constantly entering and exiting the room, with the door slamming repeatedly.
We reported the issue to reception during the night and again upon checkout, but all we received was an apology with no further resolution. For a hotel charging $550 for one night, I expected a much higher level of service and comfort. The lack of any compensation or effort to make things right was very disappointing.
Given the high cost of our stay, we feel that this experience did not reflect the standard of quality one would expect from a 5-star hotel. We had hoped for a peaceful, enjoyable stay, but instead were left with frustration and dissatisfaction.

This ruined the entire experience, as I was visiting for work with my 16 and 17 year old sons. They were trapped in the room by day and couldn’t even attend to the lagoon pool alone or attend reception to pick up food deliveries. Poor housekeeping had a job of cleaning as we’d go days without it. When I returned from working all day, tired and needing rest, I wasn’t able to.

It would be great if the resort (or casino) took more responsibility to check if minors are trying to enter areas they shouldn’t, so older teens can enjoy the experience too.

127,Mindil Beach Casino Resort,2.0,"Here's another hotel living off its position. My room wasn’t 4-star or luxury: it was basic, dated and in need of a good makeover. Housekeeping was shockingly poor and unreliable: no service at all on day 2, then 3 days of no servicing until I requested it mid-afternoon (when, instead of unwinding, I had to vacate my room again). At nearly $300 per night, I expect better.

Other low points included: centralised air-conditioning; a bathroom tap that fell off; sharing my room with a gecko; common areas stained and littered all day (or longer); being charged twice for 3 more days instead of being refunded for 3 (after complaining about housekeeping failures). So much for that relaxing break...

Sure, the sea views are great – even serial underinvestment can't spoil those - but you will pay (lots) more for the privilege, and see them from a ridiculously small, cramped balcony, of which half (literally) is taken up by an abandoned planter, now roughly covered with AstroTurf - stylish!

I won't be an inmate, sorry guest, here again. Stay in central Darwin for better choices of accommodation, bars and restaurants. It's a quick, cheap Uber ride to Mindil Beach, where you can still hang out at the Infinity pool here, visit the market and watch the sunset – then return to a modern, clean, comfortable, fairly-priced room.

No. And this is where my point lies. Ayers Rock is not the reason to visit Australia: in a 3-week trip to this beautiful country, it was the least impressive thing we saw. And the most expensive. Think about it. Are you willing to pay $600 roundtrip tickets to Ayers Rock from Sydney and spend over $400 a night in a monopoly of hotels whose rooms are worse than motels and also deal with thousands of flies that swarm on your face and clothes when you try to go on a hike? The site may be beautiful, but it is overhyped and overblown for what it really is: one rock in the middle of the desert. Is it a nice rock? Yeah, but it's not worth the price and compared to other beautiful sites in Australia (Twelve Apostles, the Blue Mountains, Cradle Mountain, Great Barrier Reef, Mountains around Cairns, Mt. Wellington, Hobart) it is on the same level of beauty, but less enjoyable to visit. Another misconception is that Uluru is the only place in Australia to see kangaroos in the wild. That is not true- there are 50 million kangaroos in that country and Ayers Rock might be one of the only places you can't see them in the country because they don't like the grass there. Just on the drive to the 12 Apostles from Melbourne, we saw a flock of Kangaroos. Also, there are plenty of them within an hours drive of Sydney. Ayers Rock is nice, but simply not as beautiful as the rest of Australia. If you go, just stay one or two nights.

161,Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,3.0,"We loved our stay at Cooinda. Our little glamping tent was super cute, the pools were fantastic and the service at the restaurant was excellent. And our morning cruise with Chrissie and Dennis was a real highlight. But I have to agree with some of the earlier reviews on cleaning. The shower blocks were riddled with black and red mould.. the morning cleaner would literally just mop around it. The drains were all blocked too, so water was just swirling and pooling from the showers on either side.. it was really unpleasant. We didn't even want to put our toddler down to stand on the floor in there. Some deep cleaning is well overdue. And while we were staying there, one of the lodge rooms across from us sat for 2 DAYS with leftover room service food all over the outside table — burgers, chips, pizza — smashed glasses on the ground and the sliding door just sitting wide open.

167,Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,3.0,"We recently stayed at the Mercure Crocodile, Kakadu for 2 nights. From this point forward, we will refer to this as the Meh-cure.
We are a family of 3 - and Accor members - and thought that although the Meh-cure was expensive (and yes, I realise July is peak season) that this would be an ideal choice for us  as a base to explore Kakadu.
Check in was good and the reception staff were lovely but sadly, that’s about the only positive I’ve got. The ‘resort’ and is use that term loosely is tired and in desperate need of a face lift. The grounds inside near the pool are woefully in need of a refresh. The landscaping and dying plants look sad. The stairs, the handrails and the walkways all need a good clean.
The room was probably fine in 1992 but not so much now. The bathroom and ‘kitchen’ are beyond worn and dated and things like the windowsill covered in dead flies is just not what you’d expect for the room rate.
Most disappointing of all was the food option. We booked to enjoy dinner at the restaurant but sadly our best option was a $55 per head buffet as we were advised that al a Carte selections would be a 45 minute wait. The food was ok but on leaving we were advised that Sunday dinner incurs a 15% surcharge (there was a sign advising this hidden behind a pot plant). It was a bit rich to fork out $200+ for a pretty average dinner.
The Meh-cure was just pretty meh really. It’s got the potential to be great again but not sure I’d bother dropping over $1k on 2 nights any time soon.",we recently stayed at the mercure crocodile kakadu for nights from this point forward we will refer to this as the mehcure we are a family of and accor members and thought that although the mehcure was expensive and yes i realise july is peak season that this would be an ideal choice for us as a base to explore kakadu check in was good and the reception staff were lovely but sadly thats about the only positive ive got the resort and is use that term loosely is tired and in desperate need of a face lift the grounds inside near the pool are woefully in need of a refresh the landscaping and dying plants look sad the stairs the handrails and the walkways all need a good clean the room was probably fine in but not so much now the bathroom and kitchen are beyond worn and dated and things like the windowsill covered in dead flies is just not what youd expect for the room rate most disappointing of all was the food option we booked to enjoy dinner at the restaurant but sadly our best option was a per head buffet as we were advised that al a carte selections would be a minute wait the food was ok but on leaving we were advised that sunday dinner incurs a surcharge there was a sign advising this hidden behind a pot plant it was a bit rich to fork out for a pretty average dinner the mehcure was just pretty meh really its got the potential to be great again but not sure id bother dropping over k on nights any time soon,we recently stay at the mercure crocodile kakadu for night from this point forward we will refer to this a the mehcure we be a family of and accor member and think that although the mehcure be expensive and yes i realise july be peak season that this would be an ideal choice for u a a base to explore kakadu check in be good and the reception staff be lovely but sadly thats about the only positive ive get the resort and be use that term loosely be tired and in desperate need of a face lift the ground inside near the pool be woefully in need of a refresh the landscaping and die plant look sad the stair the handrail and the walkway all need a good clean the room be probably fine in but not so much now the bathroom and kitchen be beyond worn and date and thing like the windowsill cover in dead fly be just not what youd expect for the room rate most disappointing of all be the food option we book to enjoy dinner at the restaurant but sadly our best option be a per head buffet a we be advise that al a carte selection would be a minute wait the food be ok but on leave we be advise that sunday dinner incur a surcharge there be a sign advise this hidden behind a pot plant it be a bit rich to fork out for a pretty average dinner the mehcure be just pretty meh really it get the potential to be great again but not sure id bother drop over k on night any time soon

- Visited in the last week of August 2022.
- Max temperature was 36 degrees daily. The heat was the most challenging but we managed.
- Due to the heat, I recommend exploring outdoor sites in the early morning (approx 630am - 1130am) and late arvo (from 4pm)
- Flies were around, but manageable. Minimal mozzies which weren't noticeable.
- 2WD Rav4
- 4 nights, 5 days
- Split trip bw Jabiru and Cooinda
- Stocked up on a lot food, dry snacks and water at Coles near Darwin Airport. This came in handy.

- Most people are standoffish and unfriendly. The customer service is below average. Suggest having low expectations.

There are flies / insects in the area (right from when we landed at the airport). Of course, there were places with more than others so preparing face nets will help with keeping them clear of your nose, mouth and ears.

251,Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,4.0,"We had a fantastic stay in the glamping tent! We’d seen a few reviews mentioning that the food was overpriced, but we have to disagree — those comments felt a bit unfair in our experience. That said, we only dined at the onsite restaurant, Mini’s, and didn’t try the casual dining section, so perhaps those reviews were referring to that instead.

As for Mini’s, we can only speak highly of it. Over our two-night stay, we had some of the best meals of our entire NT trip. The service was exceptional — the staff were genuinely attentive, asked for feedback on new dishes, remembered our names, and even gave us great tips for places to visit the next day.

We tried all the available mains and loved them, especially the cauliflower, buffalo, and barramundi. Breakfast was just as impressive, with a great variety and some of the best coffee we had on the trip.

The tent itself was also fantastic. The bed was phenomenally comfortable — so much so that we even took note of the pillow brand because it was that good!

If there’s one clear area for improvement, it would be the landscaping and toilet access. We chose a tent without a private toilet, which was fine in theory, but the shared facilities were quite a walk away. There were no clear paths through the grounds, so we often found ourselves wandering around in the dark — sometimes at 1am — weaving through other tents on uneven, unpathed ground, surrounded by cane toads. It definitely took away from the otherwise relaxing experience and wasn’t ideal for guests being disturbed by others passing by at all hours. For the price of the stay, we do expect to have clear, easy access to the bathroom.

Overall, we loved our stay and would absolutely recommend it, but a few improvements around the grounds (i.e boardwalk to amenities) could make a big difference!",we had a fantastic stay in the glamping tent wed seen a few reviews mentioning that the food was overpriced but we have to disagree those comments felt a bit unfair in our experience that said we only dined at the onsite restaurant minis and didnt try the casual dining section so perhaps those reviews were referring to that instead as for minis we can only speak highly of it over our twonight stay we had some of the best meals of our entire nt trip the service was exceptional the staff were genuinely attentive asked for feedback on new dishes remembered our names and even gave us great tips for places to visit the next day we tried all the available mains and loved them especially the cauliflower buffalo and barramundi breakfast was just as impressive with a great variety and some of the best coffee we had on the trip the tent itself was also fantastic the bed was phenomenally comfortable so much so that we even took note of the pillow brand because it was that good if theres one clear area for improvement it would be the landscaping and toilet access we chose a tent without a private toilet which was fine in theory but the shared facilities were quite a walk away there were no clear paths through the grounds so we often found ourselves wandering around in the dark sometimes at am weaving through other tents on uneven unpathed ground surrounded by cane toads it definitely took away from the otherwise relaxing experience and wasnt ideal for guests being disturbed by others passing by at all hours for the price of the stay we do expect to have clear easy access to the bathroom overall we loved our stay and would absolutely recommend it but a few improvements around the grounds ie boardwalk to amenities could make a big difference,we have a fantastic stay in the glamping tent wed see a few review mention that the food be overprice but we have to disagree those comment felt a bit unfair in our experience that say we only din at the onsite restaurant mini and didnt try the casual dining section so perhaps those review be refer to that instead a for mini we can only speak highly of it over our twonight stay we have some of the best meal of our entire nt trip the service be exceptional the staff be genuinely attentive ask for feedback on new dish remember our name and even give u great tip for place to visit the next day we try all the available main and love them especially the cauliflower buffalo and barramundi breakfast be just a impressive with a great variety and some of the best coffee we have on the trip the tent itself be also fantastic the bed be phenomenally comfortable so much so that we even take note of the pillow brand because it be that good if there one clear area for improvement it would be the landscaping and toilet access we choose a tent without a private toilet which be fine in theory but the share facility be quite a walk away there be no clear path through the ground so we often find ourselves wander around in the dark sometimes at be weave through other tent on uneven unpathed ground surround by cane toad it definitely take away from the otherwise relaxing experience and wasnt ideal for guest be disturb by others pass by at all hour for the price of the stay we do expect to have clear easy access to the bathroom overall we love our stay and would absolutely recommend it but a few improvement around the ground ie boardwalk to amenity could make a big difference

270,Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,4.0,"We stayed for 4 nights in one of the motel style rooms. We had an excellent time! Our room was very clean and well maintained. The room was also quite spacious and had a patio with furniture. The only downside was the bathroom was not spacious - a smaller corner shower cubicle with rainfall shower head, although new and quite nice. I happen to have a personal loathing of rainfall shower heads as they make washing more difficult for me.
The bed was extremely comfortable and the air con was on when we arrived, which is always appreciated.

The grounds of the resort are gorgeous - and all very flat which made it much easier for this disabled traveller.

The buffet breakfast was standard stuff, but all well prepared and fresh. Extra points for having perfectly poached eggs available.

Service from everyone was friendly and attentive. We ate in both the restaurant and the bistro and both were good. It was nice to have some better salad and fresh food options after a lengthy roadtrip through the outback where I had found myself craving fresh fruit and lightly cooked vegetables instead of chips and burgers (although both of these were available and very tasty). Bistro portions were very generous. Restaurant portions were more fine dining size, but a shared entree, a main each and a shared side was enough for dinner for us - if you're hungry definitely have three courses.

We did both the sunset and dawn yellow waters cruises. Dennis and Jess were both excellent - Dennis has a fantastic, dry sense of humour and tells great stories! From a disability access perspective, they gave me a lift on the buggy to the dock which was helpful - good to know they can if anyone travelling is a bit frail. All photos attached to this review are from the cruise. It's an extra cost but a must-do and takes off right from the resort - from home dock at the resort in wet season as the main dock is underwater. In a few weeks the take off will be a short bus trip away from the resort as the water goes.

The cruise itself was spectacular - with everything still quite wet, it was just incredible to see endless waters reflecting the sky. Even though early April is still pretty quiet for wildlife, we saw saltwater crocodiles and a lovely array of bird life! I am very sure I could happily spend months out on the water watching the seasons change.

The main pool at the resort is lovely too! It has a ramp that is a bit on the step end (pool is older than current access standards), but still easier access for me than steps.

Being in Kakadu at this time of year means that we're of course in a hot, humid and remote environment. When holidaying in the area, bring lots of water, a big hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and a lot of bug spray - you may be eaten alive regardless. I saw most tourists wearing shorts sleeves - but you are actually much better off wearing long sleeves, for both sun and bug protection. Have a look at what most tour operators are wearing - long sleeve breathable fabrics like cotton are the way :)

Highly recommend Cooinda Lodge. It's in an iconic location, the team are excellent and we finished our 4 nights happy, relaxed, energized and in awe of the incredible natural and cultural wonder that is Kakadu.",we stayed for nights

271,Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,4.0,"I really loved the convenience of Cooinda Lodge! We stayed in a lodge room. It is a teeny bit cramped for 4 people with queen and two singles (we sat around on our beds) but it's not an issue if you're out all day walking, sightseeing or in the pool. It certainly didn't bother us, and I did really like the kakadu botanicals in the bathroom!

The best part is getting to the yellow water cruises which is right outside so I don't have to drag myself at early hours in the car there.

Being close to the water you will have lots of bugs so don't leave your doors open with the lights on!

So many eating options to choose from and they aren't super cheap but I don't expect that for the middle of a national park. Fuel here as well, a store with food, camping and fishing gear.

I would stay again, and all the staff were lovely.",i really loved the convenience of cooinda lodge we stayed in a lodge room it is a teeny bit cramped for people with queen and two singles we sat around on our beds but its not an issue if youre out all day walking sightseeing or in the pool it certainly didnt bother us and i did really like the kakadu botanicals in the bathroom the best part is getting to the yellow water cruises which is right outside so i dont have to drag myself at early hours in the car there being close to the water you will have lots of bugs so dont leave your doors open with the lights on so many eating options to choose from and they arent super cheap but i dont expect that for the middle of a national park fuel here as well a store with food camping and fishing gear i would stay again and all the staff were lovely,i really love the convenience of cooinda lodge we stay in a lodge room it be a teeny bit cramp for people with queen and two single we sit around on our bed but it not an issue if youre out all day walk sightsee or in the pool it certainly didnt bother u and i do really like the kakadu botanical in the bathroom the best part be get to the yellow water cruise which be right outside so i dont have to drag myself at early hour in the car there be close to the water you will have lot of bug so dont leave your door open with the light on so many eat option to choose from and they arent super cheap but i dont expect that for the middle of a national park fuel here as well a store with food camping and fishing gear i would stay again and all the staff be lovely

293,Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,4.0,The room was nice and we loved the novelty of staying in the ‘crocodile hotel’. It was nice to jump in the pool in the afternoon after a day of exploring in the heat! The only reason we didn’t give 5 stars was because we think the buffet breakfast was lacking a little for the amount we paid (I.e could use a bit more variety).,the room was nice and we loved the novelty of staying in the crocodile hotel it was nice to jump in the pool in the afternoon after a day of exploring in the heat the only reason we didnt give stars was because we think the buffet breakfast was lacking a little for the amount we paid ie could use a bit more variety,the room be nice and we love the novelty of stay in the crocodile hotel it be nice to jump in the pool in the afternoon after a day of explore in the heat the only reason we didnt give star be because we think the buffet breakfast be lack a little for the amount we pay ie could use a bit more variety
294,Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,4.0,"Part of a road trip around the top of NT was a stop in Kakadu, and specifically the massive metropolis that is Jabiru.
Now, when staying in crocodile country, what better place to stay that a building constructed in the representative manner of a crocodile.
Whilst I waited in that car, my wife ventured inside to check in. It wasn't until later that I entered the space that is the check in area, come shop, come art gallery.
Check in quick and efficient, with quick info on best coffee in town, when the supermarket is open and how much there isn't to do around what is a very small gathering of caravan parks, a petrol station, art gallery and a few other shops ( and I do mean a few). But I digress.
Car parked in one of the three round carparks (represents crocodile eggs) and a very short walk to our ground floor room. There is a first floor ( or second if you're American or cannot count properly).
All rooms open onto the central courtyard - either looking at water features or another water feature, the pool. We're poor so we were in a standard room. Yep, it was standard, with a nice supportive bed, and great pillows. Look the older and more broken you get, the more a good pillow makes up for some other deficiencies.
It's an old hotel, that has had a few updates, but look around and you'll see the age of the joint. It may be different in more expensive rooms, but it felt like a classic Ferrari - looks great from a distance, but it's worn out and needs a proper going over to sort the dodgy fixes, suss paint job and dodgy air con.
Pillows aside (have I said, they're great pillows) the rooms are big, well, mine was. The bathroom was the old hotel shower over small bath type. With the need for a plastic suction mat in the bottom of the bath ( the same sort your nan uses to prevent slippage and mass limb fractures). And because personal hygiene requires problem solving, a shower curtain that doesn't quite close the gaps up, so water goes everywhere - especially if your my wife.
The water also never really got above tepid. Which as it was bloody hot, was not a great loss. In fact, woke me up every time I had a wash.
The room was built of plain blocks over painted, well some of it. For some reason the ceiling had bubbled and blistering paint. My guess was moisture - leak or poor cooling. Which may have been a reason for a dehumidifier or similar small appliance that was plugged in and rattling away whilst we stayed. At least it would have done so, if it didn't break down with flashing icons all over its control pad.
And whilst we're looking up, there's a fan/light contraption that is not centrally located and works off a seperate remote to all other light controls. Feels like an addition done cheaply to help the air con, which struggled. God knows what it's like in the wet season?
Plenty of power points, unlike some of the other abodes we stayed in.
Sometimes, there's a ""what the"" moment when your on holiday, and this was when I went to the patio doors. Locked with a flip lock, then added safety chain, and a large sign that advises/tells you to keep doors locked at all times. Very reassuring to know that it's more dangerous than a walking holiday through Mexican border towns. Feels like a bit of a theme in areas travelled to in the region.
Now, by reading the above you'd think I was down on the croc hotel. Nope, forget the paint, rotten skirting boards and zombie proof doors, it's a good place to stay.
The restaurant was visited on one night, and although I'd read some reviews saying the buffet was awful, we choose it. Can't be certain, but it's offered when large tour groups book in.
All the food was good, with the curry being an absolute stunner. As it's a buffet, you can gorge yourself until you can't stuff in anymore. I didn't rate the desserts though - bit sweet and a bit samey for my tastes.
To make life just a little more relaxed, I had a cocktail - again Long Island Iced Tea wins value for money.

The blockout curtains made for a great sleep. Room housekeeping service was slow and the room wasn't serviced until well into the afternoon. The location on Mindil Beach is fabulous but it was a bit disappointing that the gate to the beach wasn't always open, even in the daytime. Food is good.

Friendly and accommodating service during my late check-in (past midnight), and the lady on reception was kind enough to give me some suggestions for my time in Darwin.

Bed is comfortable, bath and shower great.

Only thing I could suggest is maybe having Chromecast compatible TVs, so guests can watch their own shows whilst relaxing.

It is a bit steeply priced, but easy to forget that when you're hanging out at the Lagoon pool!

// Back at the market before leaving Darwin tomorrow. We got there around 6 pm and spent about 20 minutes finding a parking spot—definitely come early if you’re driving!

The Sunday crowd was much bigger compared to Thursday when we first visited. Tried the pork stick (AUD 6) after a long queue—super fatty, juicy, and very salty..

Also grabbed the garlic butter corn cob (AUD 9), and it was amazing! The vendor asked if we wanted salt, I said no, and it was still delicious. Highly recommend eating the corn while it’s hot!

25 Sep 2025
// Came to the market around 4+ and it was already crowded. There’s a wide variety of food — from Chinese to Thai, Mexican, Japanese, Korean and more. We settled for a kebab and a bowl of chicken laksa.

The kebab was really good at AUD15. The flatbread was crispy, generously filled with chicken, and the mix of ingredients inside made it delicious.

The chicken laksa was less impressive. Coming from Singapore, I found it weak in flavor compared to our spicier version. The Darwin version was sweeter, with a strong coconut taste. It had so much chicken that I could hardly find the noodles.

For dessert, I tried the churros in the “must-try” Lotus flavor. It didn’t seem freshly made and wasn’t as crispy as expected. Lotus is definitely sweet — I probably clocked my sugar intake for the whole year with that dessert.

I also got 10% off for paying cash at the Laska stall.

Live music, camel rides, minor rides for kids,  quality craft & ubiquitous food stalls abound. Book table setting at Sunset Lounge to have your stall purchased meals & drinks with friends wayyy ahead! Or lug your beach chairs & picnic mats. Tables are fully occupied near the live band area early.

As for picking the right food stall - the queues are the indicator . I had seafood paella which was not bad & huge qty for $23. There's Mexican, Italian, fish + chips etc as well as the many Asian street food to pick from. The sorbet & ice-cream stalls are  - pick the smaller one with a youngish girl - 3 fresh flavours for $7.

I found my halcyon quietude on the beach before sunset at 6.30 pm on Thurs 24/7 recently - the crowds were there around me but hey! Be in the moment & block it out. Left the company of my friends to enjoy the vivid hues of NT sunset alone on the warm sand, hoping that a carelessly discarded fork won't stab me!

Lost a star because the aquarium with fish, turtles and Sting rays could be .... cleaner? Brighter? It's pretty dark and I'm not sure what can be done with that. It's the first exhibit you come across and it should be more of a WoW factor.
The crocs are *huge*, the ""cage of death"" looks fun (if the croc doesn't move in the enclosure they will move you around to another pen. 'Will' was the winner for today and put on a good. Cage of Death has a time frame of 15mins for $195 (single occupant).
The reptile house is amazing and when we walked through there was lovely young Lady with a snake and Blue Tounge Lizard ""Steven"" that you can hold. These guys are really chilled and there were a few younger kids before us that got to hold them, and waved them through the air and chased their siblings around with them and they didn't seemed phased.
Take your bathers, there's a little swimming pool you can take a dip in - the lost star includes this pool - it was filled with leaves and a bit neglected.

However, there was a bit of affecting the mood with one of the staff members who kept reminding us not to photograph the participants diving with the ""Cage of Death"" crocs. Respecting her wishes, I focused my photos on the crocodiles themselves and carefully avoiding the participants. Despite this, two staff members stand close to me, staring at me and discussing something like, ""I have told him!"" in a manner that felt somewhat dismissive.

I understand the importance of their guidelines and although I am a tourist I understand English well and knew that they were discussing me indeed.  I have thought of  showing them my photos to demonstrate my compliance... ultimately, I chose not to.

360,Kakadu National Park,5.0,"Kakadu National Park is a protected area in the Northern Territory of Australia, 171 km (106 mi) southeast of Darwin. It is a World Heritage Site. Kakadu is also gazetted as a locality, covering the same area as the national park, with 313 people recorded living there in the 2016 Australian census.

Kakadu National Park is located within the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory, covering an area of 19,804 km2 (7,646 sq mi), extending nearly 200 kilometres (124 mi) from north to south and over 100 kilometres (62 mi) from east to west. It is roughly the size of Wales or one-third the size of Tasmania, and is the second-largest national park in Australia, after the Munga-Thirri–Simpson Desert National Park. Most of the region is owned by the Aboriginal traditional owners, who have occupied the land for around 60,000 years and, today, manage the park jointly with Parks Australia. It is highly ecologically and biologically diverse, hosting a wide range of habitats and flora and fauna. It also includes a rich heritage of Aboriginal rock art, including highly significant sites, such as Ubirr. Kakadu is fully protected by the EPBC Act.

Kakadu is a place of enormous ecological and biological diversity. It extends from the coast and estuaries in the north through floodplains, billabongs and lowlands to rocky ridges and stone country in the south. These landscapes are home to a range of rare and endemic plants and animals, including more than one-third of Australia's bird species and one-quarter of its freshwater and estuarine fish species.️

卡卡杜国家公园是澳大利亚北领地的一个保护区，位于达尔文东南171公里（106英里）。它是世界遗产。卡卡杜也被列为地方政府，其面积与国家公园相同。2016年澳大利亚人口普查记录显示，共有313人居住于此。

卡卡杜国家公园位于北领地的鳄鱼河地区，占地19,804平方公里（7,646平方英里），南北绵延近200公里（124英里），东西绵延超过100公里（62英里）。它的面积大约相当于威尔士，或塔斯马尼亚岛面积的三分之一，是澳大利亚第二大国家公园，仅次于蒙加-瑟里-辛普森沙漠国家公园。该地区大部分土地归原住民传统所有者所有，他们已在此居住约6万年，如今与澳大利亚公园管理局共同管理该公园。该地区生态和生物多样性极高，拥有种类繁多的栖息地和动植物。此外，这里还拥有丰富的原住民岩画遗产，其中包括乌比尔等意义非凡的遗址。卡卡杜受到《环境、生物多样性和生物多样性法案》的全面保护。

卡卡杜拥有丰富的生态和生物多样性。它从北部的海岸和河口，穿过洪泛平原、死水潭和低地，一直延伸到南部的岩石山脊和石林。这些景观是各种珍稀特有动植物的家园，其中包括超过三分之一的澳大利亚鸟类以及四分之一的淡水和河口鱼类。️",kakadu national park is a protected area in the northern territory of australia km mi southeast of darwin it is a world heritage site kakadu is also gazetted as a locality covering the same area as the national park with people recorded living there in the australian census kakadu national park is located within the alligator rivers region of the northern territory covering an area of km sq mi extending nearly kilometres mi from north to south and over kilometres mi from east to west it is roughly the size of wales or onethird the size of tasmania and is the secondlargest national park in australia after the mungathirrisimpson desert national park most of the region is owned by the aboriginal traditional owners who have occupied the land for around years and today manage the park jointly with parks australia it is highly ecologically and biologically diverse hosting a wide range of habitats and flora and fauna it also includes a rich heritage of aboriginal rock art including highly significant sites such as ubirr kakadu is fully protected by the epbc act kakadu is a place of enormous ecological and biological diversity it extends from the coast and estuaries in the north through floodplains billabongs and lowlands to rocky ridges and stone country in the south these landscapes are home to a range of rare and endemic plants and animals including more than onethird of australias bird species and onequarter of its freshwater and estuarine fish species,kakadu national park be a protected area in the northern territory of australia km mi southeast of darwin it be a world heritage site kakadu be also gazette a a locality cover the same area a the national park with people record live there in the australian census kakadu national park be locate within the alligator river region of the northern territory cover an area of km sq mi extend nearly kilometre mi from north to south and over kilometre mi from east to west it be roughly the size of wale or onethird the size of tasmania and be the secondlargest national park in australia after the mungathirrisimpson desert national park most of the region be own by the aboriginal traditional owner who have occupy the land for around year and today manage the park jointly with park australia it be highly ecologically and biologically diverse host a wide range of habitat and flora and fauna it also include a rich heritage of aboriginal rock art include highly significant site such a ubirr kakadu be fully protect by the epbc act kakadu be a place of enormous ecological and biological diversity it extend from the coast and estuary in the north through floodplain billabong and lowlands to rocky ridge and stone country in the south these landscape be home to a range of rare and endemic plant and animal include more than onethird of australias bird specie and onequarter of it freshwater and estuarine fish specie

390,Kakadu National Park,5.0,"Whatever you do, and no matter how many days you stay in Kakadu National Park, get ready to be amazed! It's definitely one of the most beautiful national parks I have visited in my life. It's not only the biggest territorial park in the country, but it's also listed for both cultural and natural values at the UNESCO, for more than valid reasons!
1. There are so many different kinds of landscapes you can see here, with peaceful wildlife (birds, mammals, reptiles, everything!). It's tough to stop taking photos to just peaceful enjoy the privilege of being there!
2. First nations individuals and Australian governments are actively collaborating together in a Board to protect the park in the best way possible, using traditional and modern methods.
3. The best part for history and culture enthusiasts like me is that we can visit some of the first nations' caves to see fascinating rock art paintings and old ceremony sites. We can not access so much as some sites are still being used, but that's enough to give insights and teach us a lot. For this part, it is definitely better to get a local guide to have the best explanations possible.
To be fair, I visited Nourlangie (actually Burrunggui is the right name) with a mixed Caucasian/first nations guide and with a 100% Caucasian guide, and the first one provided way more insight and stories than the second (first hand experience can never be replaced, no matter how many books someone may read). I highly recommend getting a proper local guide if you can choose.

In April, Ubirr site was sadly not accessible, but the yellow water were still high and covered by water lilies. We can't get everything I guess and that made me feel that this park deserves to be visited during different seasons (they count 6 seasons there, if I remember properly).

We visited 2 cultural centers that complete each other, but if you have time for one only then Warandjan cultural center is the best (more comprehensive and better maintained with a big shop) than the Bowali center.

 Uluru – Where the Earth Speaks in Stories
Standing before Uluru (Ayers Rock), my husband and I were absolutely in awe — not just by its sheer size or its striking red glow at sunset, but by the deep, spiritual presence it holds. 
This UNESCO World Heritage site isn’t just a rock — it's a sacred site for the Anangu people, rich with ancient stories passed down through generations. Stories that teach, inspire, and guide — serving as role models for those yet to come.
 Every crevice, every color shift tells a tale.
And let’s be honest... photos don’t do it justice — you feel Uluru more than you see it.
(Pro tip: pack extra memory cards... and maybe some tissues — it’s that moving )

561,Litchfield National Park,5.0,"A great day trip. Accessible from Darwin ~1.5h. Arguably better and more accessible than Kakadu with a lot of swimming holes and day tracks. Open 24/7. Worth visiting as there are not many day trip destinations around Darwin.
A loop from Darwin- Batchelor - Litchfield - Berry springs - Darwin ia about 300km. Spend about 6-10 hours there to enjoy 3-4 spots. Can easily start from Darwin at around 6am and back to Darwin at 4pm.
2WD accessible along the main road, 4WD for some places but to explore both, you'd need at least 2 days.
⛽No fuel station inside the park, closest one is in Batchelor. Best to fill before leaving Darwin.
️ Popular spots: Wangi Fall, Florence Fall. (Best to check the reviews on specific area for more information)
‍♀️Day walk: Each spot offers ~1-3km day walk with moderate difficulty. For a day trip focusing on bush walking, it's possible to do 3-4 walks during the day. There are about 7 day walk along the main road. From my favourite to my least favourite: Wangi fall loop, Florence shady creek, Tolmer loop, Walker creek to the campsite and back, Upper Cascade, Florence to Buley, Greenants.
Overnight walk: Tabletop track, 39km multiple day hike, book online and extra preparation needed.
♿ Wheelchair friendly access includes Wangi fall and Tolmer fall (lookout point only). Some picnic area are wheelchair accessible from the car parks (such as Greenant, Walker, Buley rockhole) but mostly aren't designed for wheelchair access in mind.
‍♂️ There are so many pools. They can be very crowded. Best to come early in the morning. Pools are deep, but no current. Save for swimmers, if you are not confident, please bring inflatable noodles. Check if the swimming spots are open on the website (some are closed during wet/ early dry season due to croc risks).
Toilet + toilet paper + non potable water is normally available around car parks, but bring your own handwashing liquid.
No signal, download offline map, but you won't get lost as there is only 1 road in and out of Litchfield, there are signages around.
Bring your own food and drinking water. The only food stall is at Wangi fall, or in Batchelor town and some caravan parks between Batchelor and Litchfield.
 No rubbish bin inside the national park, carry your own rubbish bin and bring it back home.
Park is free for NT residents, interstate/ international visitors must prucase a park pass. You can only get your parks pass online. Do this before you go, no signal inside the park.
✅to bring for a day trip: swimming suit, goggles, towel, hat, sunscreen, esky, at least 2L water/person, food, hand sanitizer.
No sandflies, but mosquitos present especially at night. Flies,  spiders around river banks, not many venomous creatures to worry about, as long as you stay along the designated tracks.

The waterfall is about a flat 5 minute walk from the carpark. Two waterfalls and nice swim. Has toilet facilities but no toilet paper ... also a cafeteria onsite.

The next one we visited was Tolma Falls. You can only view it from a platform and its about 15 min walk down hill but bring water as uphill walk back to car gets very hot.

The falls we enjoyed the most is Florence waterfalls.
The plunge pool is awesome

There is 2 different ways to access it. Suggest go down to the falls via stairs as its a steeper decline and walk back via the track on.way back to car. Takes about 30 each way.

2 waterfalls.
Gorgeous swim and so clear. Near the rocky shallow part u do get fish that nibble at your feet.

Suggest to bring
1. a swimming noodle to swim out to where the falls enter the lagoon.
2. Small umbrellas on days expecting rain especially if you are with a baby or wanting to protect your belongings like electronic devices

757,Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,5.0,"Cooinda Lodge is part of the Accor Group, so was able to access my member discount/upgrade. With that in mind, we booked one of their Yellow Water Villas for four nights and were so glad we did. The villas take glamping to a new level. Elevated on stilts, you are completely immersed in the surrounding bush, overlooking the Yellow Water billabong. Our villa, ""Barramundi"", was so luxurious, spacious, filled with light and extra features. It was like a five-star hotel room with an outlook that can't be beaten. It even had an outdoor bathtub on the deck.

The staff at the lodge were extremely helpful. The breakfast, which was included, at Mimi's Restaurant was really good - plenty of choices, freshly brewed coffee and squeezed juices. We spent so much time trekking around Kakadu then we didn't get much time to appreciate all the features at the lodge, however we did get the opportunity to watch the footy on the big screen whilst have dinner at the Barra Bar.

Perfect location to take advantage of the sunrise and sunset Yellow Water Cruises, as the bus picked us up from a stop in front of the main reception.

778,Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,5.0,"Amazing place! Make an excuse to go here! I went during the end of wet season (big difference in the place in different seasons). Food was splendid with loads to choose and they changed the ingredients in one thing I tried which was brilliant! Accessibility was ok with a regular step to get into the regular Lodge room. Back door was a wide veranda sliding door which was pretty flat. Spotless rooms! Aircon worked great! Plenty of plug sockets in good place. No wifi in the Lodge rooms. Rainfall shower head only. Bit of a walk to the parking areas across grass, and they seemed to fill fast without assigned parking, but if you need help getting about they have a small golf cart, although that has a huge step to get up. Pool had a nice ramp leading down into it, no railing though and with a small step on the edge of the pool. Staff were amazing! Very happy to help in any way possible!

One hidden gem is the art gallery and shop in the lobby—it's seriously underrated. It showcases a range of artworks by Aboriginal artists, many of which are available at very reasonable prices. I highly recommend setting aside time to explore—it feels like a treasure hunt with the added reward of supporting the local community.

This hotel is in the heart of the Kakadu National Park. Make sure you have the permits you need to travel and refuel in and out of this area as access is restricted.

That said, once here, this hotel has the most lovely, attentive staff in reception and everywhere. Nothing was too much trouble, if they didn't have something to hand, they knew who did and got right on the phone.

The menu in the restaurant is not extensive, but the choice is wide enough that there is something for everyone, and what they do have is cooked to perfection. I had Kangaroo loin like I have never ad it before, slightly smoked and a joy to the palate.

Lots of nice cold beer and wine, and a buffer breakfast with all the vest and fresh you could want.

There's a lovely pool, plentiful indigenous arts and craft on display and for sale, and a pleasant gift shop with some items at prices significantly lower than in the ""big smoke."". I paid $55 for an indigenous shirt that was being sold in Darwin for 90.

Plenty of opportunities for walks, lookouts, river cruises and local attractions within an easy 30 minute drive

827,Mindil Beach Casino Resort,5.0,"Without a doubt, the best location to stay in Darwin!
My experience at Mindil Beach Casino Resort was absolutely outstanding from start to finish. I received a warm and welcoming reception upon arrival, and was even able to check in a little early – a much appreciated gesture after a long day of travel.

My room was beautiful: spacious, tastefully decorated, and with a breathtaking view of the ocean. Everything was spotlessly clean and the entire hotel smells wonderfully fresh. You can truly feel the care and attention that goes into every detail here.

The facilities are fantastic – two stunning swimming pools (one with a view of the sea), direct beach access within walking distance, and a range of high-quality restaurants that serve delicious food. Dining here is a real treat!

Perfect location, right next to the Mindil Market as well.

What truly makes this resort stand out is the exceptional service. The staff are warm, professional, and quick to assist with anything you might need. A special shout-out to Sreena Amir and Kellie who went above and beyond to make my stay feel extra special – thank you for your kindness and hospitality!

If I had to mention one small point for improvement: there are no power outlets directly next to the bed, which made charging my phone slightly inconvenient. But honestly, that’s the only minor detail in what was otherwise a flawless experience.

There’s a huge variety of food stalls offering global cuisines — from American and Southern European to Southeast Asian and classic Aussie — alongside quirky arts and crafts, all run by local vendors. Supporting NT small businesses made the experience even more meaningful.

Live music and whip-cracking demonstrations added to the entertainment, and for something a little different, camel rides along the beach are also available. Facilities were thoughtfully laid out, with toilets at both ends, portable ATMs, and plenty of parking (we Ubered there with no trouble at all).

Prices were a little above average, but that’s expected in Darwin.

854,Mindil Beach Sunset Market,5.0,"I always visit the Mindil Beach Sunset Markets while I am in Darwin,  as it is always a highlight for me:) The markets run every Thursday and Sunday from 4 pm to 9 pm, during the dry season which is late April through to late October.

It does get extremely busy, so the crowds might not be for everyone. But the main attraction is the sunset. The view from Mindil Beach is pretty special; The sun looks bigger here as it sets right over the Arafura sea and you get that uninterrupted horizon. It’s one of those sunsets that really stops you in your tracks. Everyone claps when it is over because it is spectacular!

There’s a great mix of street food stalls, local arts and crafts, and live music. I even saw people doing camel rides along the beach as the sun was coming down.

Something to note – you can’t bring dogs into the market area, unless it’s a certified assistance dog. It’s a bit of a shame if you’re travelling with your pet, but good to know before you go.

In July, the sun sets around 6.30 pm, so it’s worth getting there early to find a good spot, and get a good car park.

Wear comfy shoes as short walk to from bus to market (6min / 200m on fairly flat ground), but careful of white shoes, as carpark is red dirt. Heat drops down after sunset. Bring handwipes/serviettes/hand sanitiser if you like to stay clean & fresh as theres lots of people & lots of yummy food trucks. Lines for food can be a bit long, but so worth it. Be aware- most of the food vendors DON'T sell drinks, however there are many vendors selling different types of fresh drinks, like tropical juices etc. We had the famous Croc burger, the patty has fresh mango & sweet chilli- amazing, & the chips that were an optional side were delicious & a generous portion. We also tried the BBQ prawns on skewers- yum!! Constant fresh supply being brought out to serve. The market stalls- so much jewelry,  lots of freshwater pearls. Lots of clothing, art & crafts, Crocodile/tourism souvenirs, although some items overpriced. Sunset at beach was lovely, however packed with people.

881,Mindil Beach Sunset Market,5.0,"During the dry season, this market opens twice a week. There are many food options here, and my favorite is a small seafood stall with a blue tent, selling cooked lobster, mud crab, octopus, large prawns, and oysters. I’ve been here several times and tried them all—they're all fresh and delicious. Afterward, I head to a fresh juice stall for a cup of mixed juice or fruit tea. Finally, I go to a fruit stall to buy some freshly peeled jackfruit as dessert. For me, that’s a perfect dinner. As the sky gradually darkens and turns pink, I watch the beautiful sunset on the beach. There’s a special tradition here: when the sun finally dips below the horizon, everyone cheers and claps, celebrating the end of the hot day and the arrival of the cool, comfortable evening.

961,Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,,"Cooinda Lodge is part of the Accor Group, so was able to access my member discount/upgrade. With that in mind, we booked one of their Yellow Water Villas for four nights and were so glad we did. The villas take glamping to a new level. Elevated on stilts, you are completely immersed in the surrounding bush, overlooking the Yellow Water billabong. Our villa, ""Barramundi"", was so luxurious, spacious, filled with light and extra features. It was like a five-star hotel room with an outlook that can't be beaten. It even had an outdoor bathtub on the deck. ||The staff at the lodge were extremely helpful. The breakfast, which was included, at Mimi's Restaurant was really good - plenty of choices, freshly brewed coffee and squeezed juices.

983,Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,,"We stayed here for one night as part of a three day ATT Kings tour to Kakadu and Nitmiluk National Parks, so I cannot comment on the value for money but I am guessing it’s not going to be cheap in high season, as it is virtually the only show in town as hotels go in Kakadu, and the crocodile design is funky but reduces the number of rooms to around 120 I believe, so it is well over subscribed and was full to bursting on the night we were in.|Yes, the rooms are dated, especially the bathroom, where the fittings are from the 1970’s, but the water pressure and temperature were both excellent and the whole bathroom was clean and white, very very white.|The bedroom was spacious with two comfortable queen beds and room for a table and two chairs by the window.|The public areas including the restaurant are a lot more modern in appearance and the front lobby and associated corridor is done out more like a gallery for aboriginal art.|There are no other restaurant options in Jabiru so eating in the hotel it is. We had a buffet lunch in the hotel and if I had a complaint, it was that the evening menu was dominated by another buffet at $55 per person and there wasn’t a lot of choice outside of that. It was disappointing to find no small plate menu available from the bar and even going to the restaurant just for starters from the a la carte menu wasn’t an option as the wait times quoted were inhibitive, as the hotel clearly only wanted to be bothered by serving the buffet. |The hotel location is isolated, just as Jabiru is, so you would think very quiet. So, I was initially confused to why the hotel provides ear plugs by your bed. The insulation seemed adequate, and we didn’t get any noise bleed through from the room above or beside us. However the front door of the room faces forward into the bush, and it all became clear as the sun came up. Let’s just say the dawn chorus provided by the parrots and parakeets who came to wake up in the trees outside the hotel rooms was one of the most spectacular natures sounds I have ever had the pleasure to hear. We pleasure to hear as I am not Australian and its very different to the blackbird morning chorus, so I am guessing if you have heard it loads of times before it loses its appeal, hence the now provided ear plugs.",we stayed here for one night as part of a three day att kings tour to kakadu and nitmiluk national parks so i cannot comment on the value for money but i am guessing its not going to be cheap in high season as it is virtually the only show in town as hotels go in kakadu and the crocodile design is funky but reduces the number of rooms to around i believe so it is well over subscribed and was full to bursting on the night we were inyes the rooms are dated especially the bathroom where the fittings are from the s but the water pressure and temperature were both excellent and the whole bathroom was clean and white very very whitethe bedroom was spacious with two comfortable queen beds and room for a table and two chairs by the windowthe public areas including the restaurant are a lot more modern in appearance and the front lobby and associated corridor is done out more like a gallery for aboriginal artthere are no other restaurant options in jabiru so eating in the hotel it is we had a buffet lunch in the hotel and if i had a complaint it was that the evening menu was dominated by another buffet at per person and there wasnt a lot of choice outside of that it was disappointing to find no small plate menu available from the bar and even going to the restaurant just for starters from the a la carte menu wasnt an option as the wait times quoted were inhibitive as the hotel clearly only wanted to be bothered by serving the buffet the hotel location is isolated just as jabiru is so you would think very quiet so i was initially confused to why the hotel provides ear plugs by your bed the insulation seemed adequate and we didnt get any noise bleed through from the room above or beside us however the front door of the room faces forward into the bush and it all became clear as the sun came up lets just say the dawn chorus provided by the parrots and parakeets who came to wake up in the trees outside the hotel rooms was one of the most spectacular natures sounds i have ever had the pleasure to hear we pleasure to hear as i am not australian and its very different to the blackbird morning chorus so i am guessing if you have heard it loads of times before it loses its appeal hence the now provided ear plugs,we stay here for one night a part of a three day att king tour to kakadu and nitmiluk national park so i can not comment on the value for money but i be guess it not go to be cheap in high season a it be virtually the only show in town a hotel go in kakadu and the crocodile design be funky but reduce the number of room to around i believe so it be well over subscribed and be full to burst on the night we be inyes the room be date especially the bathroom where the fitting be from the s but the water pressure and temperature be both excellent and the whole bathroom be clean and white very very whitethe bedroom be spacious with two comfortable queen bed and room for a table and two chair by the windowthe public area include the restaurant be a lot more modern in appearance and the front lobby and associate corridor be do out more like a gallery for aboriginal artthere be no other restaurant option in jabiru so eating in the hotel it be we have a buffet lunch in the hotel and if i have a complaint it be that the evening menu be dominate by another buffet at per person and there wasnt a lot of choice outside of that it be disappoint to find no small plate menu available from the bar and even go to the restaurant just for starter from the a la carte menu wasnt an option a the wait time quote be inhibitive a the hotel clearly only want to be bother by serve the buffet the hotel location be isolated just a jabiru be so you would think very quiet so i be initially confuse to why the hotel provide ear plug by your bed the insulation seem adequate and we didnt get any noise bleed through from the room above or beside u however the front door of the room face forward into the bush and it all become clear a the sun come up let just say the dawn chorus provide by the parrot and parakeet who come to wake up in the tree outside the hotel room be one of the most spectacular nature sound i have ever have the pleasure to hear we pleasure to hear a i be not australian and it very different to the blackbird morning chorus so i be guess if you have hear it load of time before it lose it appeal hence the now provide ear plug
