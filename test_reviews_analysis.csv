There was no signage or any real warning that all the swimming spots and most walking tracks were closed. Even when you book accommodation they don’t bother telling you. It’s a long way to go to end up using a man made swimming pool  Litchfield is  nicer, more user friendly, better sights and swimming and you don’t have to drive half the day to see that something is closed.

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,1.0,"The rooms are a little dated, in particular the bathroom. Outside the room area very dated and no nice area to sit. However, the restaurant meal was the worst I have had. When we ordered, the waitress was tapping her pen when my wife was deciding on her meal. She seemed more interested in getting back behind the counter. When the meal was delivered, entree and my wife’s meal was delivered. After 25 minutes and my 3rd drink, I then had to go ask where my meal was, the reply, “ did you want the meals together” which I said yes to, the waitress then said she would see where it was. 15minutes later, my wife’s meal has well and truly finished her meal. At this stage I had to go back up, tell them I wanted my meal, to again the waitress replied I’ll see where it is. Some time after that my meal finally arrived, they had already cleared the table of entree and my wife’s main. Some time later a waiter then apologized for the meal.

Our room's fan didn't work, and even though we booked for three people, there were only two coffee mugs provided. Two of the restaurant staff came across as rude and unwelcoming. Even though we booked, the guy at the restaurant desk on arrival seemed so bothered by our presence. We had to eat from the buffet because the guy said the kitchen closes in 3 minutes, so we didn't really have an option. The food was average at best. The waitress accidentally smashed a wine glass on our table, which damaged my mum's bag. While they did apologise, their attitude felt dismissive.

Our room's fan didn't work, and even though we booked for three people, there were only two coffee mugs provided. Two of the restaurant staff came across as rude and unwelcoming. Even though we booked, the guy at the restaurant desk on arrival seemed so bothered by our presence. We had to eat from the buffet because the guy said the kitchen closes in 3 minutes, so we didn't really have an option. The food was average at best.

I am writing to express my concerns regarding our current stay at your hotel in Room 112.

Upon entering the room, we noticed black mold on the ceiling, which raised immediate health and safety concerns. While we understand that issues like these can sometimes arise, we would have expected them to be addressed promptly for the safety and comfort of guests. We did not feel comfortable staying in a room with visible mold, and this significantly impacted our experience.

Additionally, during our stay, we encountered an issue with the Wi-Fi, which was not functional. When we raised this concern with the front desk, the response we received was dismissive, with the staff member implying that this was expected because we were in a remote area. Furthermore, another guest also dismissed our concerns, making us feel that our complaints were not taken seriously.

As a result, we felt that our experience was far below the standard that we expected from your establishment, particularly in terms of guest service and room conditions. While we understand that the location may have limitations, we believe it’s important to maintain a certain level of service and cleanliness for all guests, regardless of the setting.

We are only staying for one night, but I wanted to bring these issues to your attention so that future guests do not encounter the same problems. I hope that you can take these concerns seriously and work toward improving the room conditions and customer service in the future.",STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!,other,neutral

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,1.0,"Thank you for the opportunity to review our stay.

We have travelled extensively both domestically and internationally and I must say our experience at Kakadu Crocodile Hotel was not a highlight.

Whilst the staff are great and the novel design concept sort of works the rooms are so outdated it is pathetic.

We had to ask for an additional chair as we only had the beds as a sitting option for 2 people.

No lounge chairs in the room and there is room for them.

Shower over bath – really ! Shower rose leaked badly.

NO lift – we were on the 1st floor and had to manage everything up the stairs.

No ceiling fan in the NT – it’s the ONLY place we stayed at that didn’t have one.

Size of fridge was hopeless for us to store our perishable supplies – the bar did give us extra ice for the esky which helped.

We didn’t eat there as the lady on reception recommended somewhere else…… which worked out great.

I would rate the accommodation at 2 stars.

Value for money  1 star.

Mindil Beach Casino Resort,1.0,"The worst ever !!!!

Paid $10,000 for 2 rooms for 3 nights

The list

1 mouldy bathrooms
2 bar fridge set to freeze and froze our room service beers and my medication
3 no bottle open in room to even open beers
4 one roll of toilet paper for 3 nights
5 dirty plates left at front door after room cleaning all afternoon
6 no kettle in room
7 used microwave in room to heat water for cuppa and found a previous guests dirty cup, teabag and milk in mwo. Not sure how long it had been there, but didn’t smell great
8 leaking toilet noisy for 3 days and 3 nights
9 no evening turn down service to refresh towels used throughout the day
10 coffee shop tables where very sticky even the pepper and salt stuck to the table
11 can’t call reception after 8pm as phone didn’t work
12 pool sun lounger cushions are dirty and an eye sore to look at. I would lay on them.
13 front door entry dirty
14 rubbish in front garden for entire stay
15 outdoor shower dirty and didn’t work - tap handle fell off when we tested it.
16 furniture old and stained - even a burnt iron mark on the coffee table, amongst others

DONT EVER STAY HERE…… STAY AT VIBE AT THE DARWIN WATERFRONT …… much better location and I am sure the standards will be much higher than here - wouldn’t be hard really.

Paying super high room rates for a 5 star hotel - not sure how they got this rating….. but no more than a 3 stars in my opinion.  Extremely disappointed to say the least.

Spoke to Eddie the manager, very apologetic on the phone at the time, but nothing changed for our next 2 nights stay!!!!

The list

1 mouldy bathrooms
2 bar fridge set to freeze and froze our room service beers and my medication
3 no bottle open in room to even open beers
4 one roll of toilet paper for 3 nights
5 dirty plates left at front door after room cleaning all afternoon
6 no kettle in room
7 used microwave in room to heat water for cuppa and found a previous guests dirty cup, teabag and milk in mwo. Not sure how long it had been there, but didn’t smell great
8 leaking toilet noisy for 3 days and 3 nights
9 no evening turn down service to refresh towels used throughout the day
10 coffee shop tables where very sticky even the pepper and salt stuck to the table
11 can’t call reception after 8pm as phone didn’t work
12 pool sun lounger cushions are dirty and an eye sore to look at. I would lay on them.
13 front door entry dirty
14 rubbish in front garden for entire stay
15 outdoor shower dirty and didn’t work - tap handle fell off when we tested it.
16 furniture old and stained - even a burnt iron mark on the coffee table, amongst others

DONT EVER STAY HERE…… STAY AT VIBE AT THE DARWIN WATERFRONT …… much better location and I am sure the standards will be much higher than here - wouldn’t be hard really.

Paying super high room rates for a 5 star hotel - not sure how they got this rating….. but no more than a 3 stars in my opinion.  Extremely disappointed to say the least.

Spoke to Eddie the manager, very apologetic on the phone at the time, but nothing changed for our next 2 nights stay!!!!

Mindil Beach Casino Resort,1.0,"My husband and I are visitors to Australia from UK.
This afternoon we came across a semi conscious aboriginal man in a ditch near Mindil Beach. He appeared in very poor shape. Not having Australian phones we rushed to the nearest place and reported what we had seen and asked the staff at the entrance of the casino to raise some help for the man. The staff said they would draw attention of the situation to their manager. An hour later the aboriginal man was still in the same position.  I gave him some water which sadly he was in no fit condition to drink and returned to the casino to find out what action had been taken.
On speaking with the manager we were told no action had been taken. I was told the man is outside the resort grounds and not their responsibility. I understand that and was not asking them to do anything to physically help personally, merely to phone the emergency services. They refused and refused even to allow me to make a call to the emergency services from their landline saying they did not have phones.
I am astounded at the stance the manager of the casino took.
A very kind passer by eventually helped us by logging a call with emergency services so that the aboriginal man could get medical assistance. I hope it was not too late as the man was in a bad state. I do not believe his problem was alcohol related.
Make your own mind up whether what the stance of the casino resort staff was morally wrong. I was considering a holiday at the resort but will give it a miss.",My husband and I are visitors to Australia from UK.,other,neutral

This afternoon we came across a semi conscious aboriginal man in a ditch near Mindil Beach. He appeared in very poor shape. Not having Australian phones we rushed to the nearest place and reported what we had seen and asked the staff at the entrance of the casino to raise some help for the man. The staff said they would draw attention of the situation to their manager. An hour later the aboriginal man was still in the same position.  I gave him some water which sadly he was in no fit condition to drink and returned to the casino to find out what action had been taken.

The furniture was visibly stained and dirty. Staff themselves friendly but resort looks in a mess all the time with left over glasses and trays staying outside for days along with room services and housekeeping items

Reception staff are inconsistent when providing information and no 2 answer are the same. You stay here for thr luxury which all turned into a hassle. I wouldn't wait waste your money in the resort stick to a basic room.

They truly don't have the customer aspect down and not what you would expect from a resort hotel.

Mindil Beach Casino Resort,1.0,"Definitely not worth it for the price you pay. My partner and I stayed there for a week and were very disappointed.
There was mould all through out the room. The spa bath was not working so I asked reception about it. After 5 hours and 6 employees in my room it was finally fixed. The rooms are very outdated and do not even have smart tvs so you can only choose between a few free to air channels or a movie for $15-$20.
I ordered room service and the meal was terrible, couldn’t even finish it.
The service was average, took a long time to check in and told me poor directions to the gym.
The cleaners came in daily but never changed the sheets just remade the bed, I could tell because there was mould on the sheets.

We left externally ane utterly disappointed in how we were unfairly treated after being ask to leave due to carrying our small dog. We had parked on the grass area and entered where the Mindal Market sign appeared and did not say “NO ANIMALS”.

My question is where were these signs ??? Why wasn’t this more obvious ?? After driving all the way into the city to this market and to be disappointed and forced to leave is disgraceful. The Site manager was very unprofessional and externally rude after stalking us and making us feel very victimised.

I was at the crocodile leather shop making a big purchase then this extremely rude thug of a security guard came up behind me and just started demanding me and my partner to leave because of some unreasonable no dog policy , ok where are the clearly marked signs , and it’s a public place.
I was in the middle  of making a 220 dollar purchase he didn’t even want to let me finish I told that he was  harassing me and my partner, she and I felt extremely threatened , it triggered my anxiety and ptsd response..
people around me saw and heard what was happening and were disgusted by what was going on as the thug security guard was adamant on forcing my partner and I out of this public place. I said wasn’t aware of this policy and where are no dog signs and will leave after I make this purchase, he refused to be reasonable instead He continued to be threatening and unprofessional as I was trying to pay for my 220 purchase.
We started to leave and then he started following my partner and I and continued to harass us . A group of about 10 concerned bystanders saw what was going on and came up to us as support just in case the security guard got violent.
We left feeling disappointed as this was  our welcome to Darwin.
The positive was the community support that came to our defence as they all saw the disgusting behaviour of this thug of a security guard.. well done to them there is hope..and shows the community’s real voice on this situation..

Crocosaurus Cove,1.0,"After seeing the magnificent crocodiles at the park, I wandered down to the crocosaurus cove cafe in search of a hot chocolate. As I was ordering the barista was rather rude and did not have very effective  communication skills. After waiting the lifespan of a crocodile, I received my hot milk. Like a crocodile, I was hunting... For the taste of chocolate tho... Long story short, the crocodiles were magnificent, the hot chocolate was not.

After my warm milk, I needed to use the restroom. Sadly I could not bear to stay in there longer than 20 seconds. I have three words for you... Grimy, dated and mouldy. There was grime and crusty god knows what on the wall. Now creepers get excited... The communal hand basins at crocosaurus cove are the perfect opportunity for you to snatch some children. Their toilet facilities are as unsafe as the crocodiles who reside at the cove.

Washing machine and dryers are $6 each

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,2.0,"The staff are kind & friendly but this is an establishment with a significant deferred maintenance problem. The rooms are grubby and rundown. Among the issues in my room alone (I didn’t venture into the outdoor areas):

- the air filter is filthy & clogged with lint (I’m sure it would contravene health regulations);
- the bathroom is tired and only superficially clean. (The bathroom should really be gutted and refitted but if there isn’t sufficient money to do that, a team of deep cleaners needs to come through the place to clean and sterilise the bathrooms from top to bottom.);
- the curtain rod has detached from the curtain, so the only way to open and close it is to grab the fabric, which adds to the grubbiness problem;
- the cushions on the lounge chairs need replacing - they have been compressed to the point that they no longer qualify as cushions;
- the fridge is old and incapable of adequate cooling (BTW, my fridge contained a water bottle with no water in it. I had to buy water from the supermarket);
- the overhead fan needs cleaning to remove the dust and lint that have accumulated, probably over years

The daily spit & polish performed by backpacker staff is obviously insufficient to deal with such issues. Nor is it an overnight fix, there is just too much to be done. What is required is a comprehensive management plan to work systematically through the deferred maintenance that has been backing up for years.

If my experience in the restaurant is anything to go by, I suspect understaffing may be partly to blame. Two or 3 pleasant but anxious young wait staff scurry about the place at buffet breakfast sittings while patrons resort to drinking hot tea out of glasses and eating cereal from plates because the cups and bowls have run out.

It pains me to record such things as I have no doubt everyone, including management, is doing their best. I suspect the fundamental problem here is declining revenue as people tighten their belts under cost of living pressures. But there’s no point gilding the lily, business as usual is no longer an option. Someone in charge needs to put their mind to the maintenance and refurbishment problem before revenue dries up completely.",The staff are kind & friendly but this is an establishment with a significant deferred maintenance problem.,"facility, service",positive

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,2.0,"I have traveled extensively around Australia and overseas throughout the last 30 years, and I’ve stayed in everything from 2-5 star hotels, most of which were an accurate reflection of their rating and price, and therefore offered satisfaction, however this hotel was a huge disappointment, and had I not committed to sightseeing activities for the second day of my visit, I would have cut my trip short by a day!

This hotel is 2-3 star at best; rooms are dated, poorly equipped, maintenance is lacking with the usual evidence; noisy air conditioning, cracked bathroom sink and floor tiles and an odour!

Despite my visit occurring in the wet season (low season) the prices are what you would expect to pay for a 4 star hotel in Sydney that comes with modern furnishings and quality dining.

Some of the staff were polite and professional however most of the staff were sultry and clearly unimpressed with the intrusion by guests.

Dining…..let me put a diplomatic spin on my impression…..pretentious and overpriced!

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,2.0,"The room was average, it could use an update. The lobby and restaurant give the allure of a high quality hotel, but the room did not equate. The fridge didn’t work properly, it kept food ‘cool’ but not cold. My biggest issue was the lack of wifi although advertised as having such. I was told it was because it was busy and too many people were accessing. This made sense however this should be remedied by improving wifi situation. I did not have cell service in Kakadu so wifi was important for communicating with my family.

Mindil Beach Casino Resort,2.0,"I’m extremely disappointed with our recent stay in the Lagoon King Room on Friday, 21st March 2025. What should have been a relaxing family getaway to celebrate my birthday turned into a stressful and frustrating experience due to excessive noise from the neighbouring room. Between 9:00 PM and 6:00 AM, we were kept awake by loud arguments, swearing, fighting, and people constantly entering and exiting the room, with the door slamming repeatedly.
We reported the issue to reception during the night and again upon checkout, but all we received was an apology with no further resolution. For a hotel charging $550 for one night, I expected a much higher level of service and comfort. The lack of any compensation or effort to make things right was very disappointing.
Given the high cost of our stay, we feel that this experience did not reflect the standard of quality one would expect from a 5-star hotel. We had hoped for a peaceful, enjoyable stay, but instead were left with frustration and dissatisfaction.
I’m sharing this review so that others can be aware of the potential for a poor experience, even at this price point.","Im extremely disappointed with our recent stay in the Lagoon King Room on Friday, 21st March 2025.","facility, experience",negative

Mindil Beach Casino Resort,2.0,"The resort ticked every box for me - location, comfort of rooms, staff, lagoon pool … however, on arrival a sign in the reception stated teens under 18 need to always be accompanied by an adult when moving through the resort. This ruined the entire experience, as I was visiting for work with my 16 and 17 year old sons. They were trapped in the room by day and couldn’t even attend to the lagoon pool alone or attend reception to pick up food deliveries. Poor housekeeping had a job of cleaning as we’d go days without it. When I returned from working all day, tired and needing rest, I wasn’t able to. I didn’t see this ‘rule’ when I booked the accommodation and wouldn’t have stayed there if I had. We successfully ignored the Casino and other areas (intentionally). It would be great if the resort (or casino) took more responsibility to check if minors are trying to enter areas they shouldn’t, so older teens can enjoy the experience too. The only other disappointing thing was having to walk past the outdoor smokers area of the casino.

Mindil Beach Casino Resort,2.0,"Here's another hotel living off its position. My room wasn’t 4-star or luxury: it was basic, dated and in need of a good makeover. Housekeeping was shockingly poor and unreliable: no service at all on day 2, then 3 days of no servicing until I requested it mid-afternoon (when, instead of unwinding, I had to vacate my room again). At nearly $300 per night, I expect better.

Other low points included: centralised air-conditioning; a bathroom tap that fell off; sharing my room with a gecko; common areas stained and littered all day (or longer); being charged twice for 3 more days instead of being refunded for 3 (after complaining about housekeeping failures). So much for that relaxing break...

Sure, the sea views are great – even serial underinvestment can't spoil those - but you will pay (lots) more for the privilege, and see them from a ridiculously small, cramped balcony, of which half (literally) is taken up by an abandoned planter, now roughly covered with AstroTurf - stylish!

I won't be an inmate, sorry guest, here again. Stay in central Darwin for better choices of accommodation, bars and restaurants. It's a quick, cheap Uber ride to Mindil Beach, where you can still hang out at the Infinity pool here, visit the market and watch the sunset – then return to a modern, clean, comfortable, fairly-priced room.

The lizards were pacing in their enclosures and clearly weren't happy either - definitely won't be back.

Also the girl at the front was rude.",Also the girl at the front was rude.,service,negative
Crocosaurus Cove,2.0,Was okay. We had done the Adelaide River Croc cruise before arriving in Darwin and found it a little sad that the crocs were in small pens.

Think seeing them feed in their own habitat may have jaded our opinion.,Was okay.,other,positive

Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,3.0,"The general overall feel and vibe of the Lodge is great.  The layout and access are good, the grounds are immaculate, and the pricing is reasonable.  Where it falls down for my mind is in the facilities, especially for food and drink.  The lodge seems to suit the caravanning crowd, but not the cabin accommodation.  There are no cooking facilities in the rooms, not even a microwave.  This then makes you have to use the Lodges meal facilities.  These are only open at certain times and is all al a carte.  Dinner and Breakfast are fine but, outside these times, you can only purchase snacks form the Shop.  There is plenty to purchase if you were camping, but not much if you cannot cook/reheat etc.  The idea of having a buffet lunch was awesome until we found out it was only for the tourist bus groups and after being rudely pushed out of the way by some seemingly very hungry individuals of said group, we gave up and fed on snacks.

There were many water bugs flying around in the open-air restaurant and around our property, which freaked the kids out. Room was otherwise comfortable and clean and the bed was decent. Presence of a showerhead in the bathroom instead of only a rain shower would help those who have to clean their kids up. The minimart is well stocked.

There were many water bugs flying around in the open-air restaurant and around our property, which freaked the kids out. Room was otherwise comfortable and clean and the bed was decent. Presence of a showerhead in the bathroom instead of only a rain shower would help those who have to clean their kids up. The minimart is well stocked. Overall the prices are that of a 5 star premium accommodation and if it could be around the AUD250-280 range I think that would be more reasonable, considering no breakfast included, etc.","There were many water bugs flying around in the open-air restaurant and around our property, which freaked the kids out.",food,negative

Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,3.0,"We loved our stay at Cooinda. Our little glamping tent was super cute, the pools were fantastic and the service at the restaurant was excellent. And our morning cruise with Chrissie and Dennis was a real highlight. But I have to agree with some of the earlier reviews on cleaning. The shower blocks were riddled with black and red mould.. the morning cleaner would literally just mop around it. The drains were all blocked too, so water was just swirling and pooling from the showers on either side.. it was really unpleasant. We didn't even want to put our toddler down to stand on the floor in there. Some deep cleaning is well overdue. And while we were staying there, one of the lodge rooms across from us sat for 2 DAYS with leftover room service food all over the outside table — burgers, chips, pizza — smashed glasses on the ground and the sliding door just sitting wide open.

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,3.0,"We recently stayed at the Mercure Crocodile, Kakadu for 2 nights. From this point forward, we will refer to this as the Meh-cure.
We are a family of 3 - and Accor members - and thought that although the Meh-cure was expensive (and yes, I realise July is peak season) that this would be an ideal choice for us  as a base to explore Kakadu.
Check in was good and the reception staff were lovely but sadly, that’s about the only positive I’ve got. The ‘resort’ and is use that term loosely is tired and in desperate need of a face lift. The grounds inside near the pool are woefully in need of a refresh. The landscaping and dying plants look sad. The stairs, the handrails and the walkways all need a good clean.
The room was probably fine in 1992 but not so much now. The bathroom and ‘kitchen’ are beyond worn and dated and things like the windowsill covered in dead flies is just not what you’d expect for the room rate.
Most disappointing of all was the food option. We booked to enjoy dinner at the restaurant but sadly our best option was a $55 per head buffet as we were advised that al a Carte selections would be a 45 minute wait. The food was ok but on leaving we were advised that Sunday dinner incurs a 15% surcharge (there was a sign advising this hidden behind a pot plant). It was a bit rich to fork out $200+ for a pretty average dinner.
The Meh-cure was just pretty meh really. It’s got the potential to be great again but not sure I’d bother dropping over $1k on 2 nights any time soon.","We recently stayed at the Mercure Crocodile, Kakadu for 2 nights.",other,neutral

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,3.0,"AVERAGE

We booked a superior twin room, it was rather compact and a little dated

There is no microwave only a jug to make a coffee

You are in the middle of no where so you need to take this into consideration , there is not much choice of anything,

There is a supermarket but at least in our room we could not heat or cook anything

The restaurant is one of three eating places in the area and I only go to eat at the Crocodile hotel restaurant

The staff were not welcoming, we arrived 6 minutes before 6pm and was told we could not order a drink and sit at our table until 6pm and that we would have to sit at the bar, bar and wait staff seemed to just doing what they had to to get paid, no interest in anything or anyone

I also didn’t find the gardens set out well for guests, not much under cover for the 35 degree days
You will also be required to drag your suitcases up a heap of stairs to get to your room, they may help, I’m not sure, but no one offered to help us

If I returned I would probably try another accommodation","AVERAGE We booked a superior twin room, it was rather compact and a little dated There is no microwave only a jug to make a coffee You are in the middle of no where so you need to take this into consideration , there is not much choice of anything, There is a supermarket but at least in our room we could not heat or cook anything The restaurant is one of three eating places in the area and I only go to eat at the Crocodile hotel restaurant The staff were not welcoming, we arrived 6 minutes before 6pm and was told we could not order a drink and sit at our table until 6pm and that we would have to sit at the bar, bar and wait staff seemed to just doing what they had to to get paid, no interest in anything or anyone I also didnt find the gardens set out well for guests, not much under cover for the 35 degree days You will also be required to drag your suitcases up a heap of stairs to get to your room, they may help, Im not sure, but no one offered to help us If I returned I would probably try another accommodation","facility, service, food, environment",positive

It was also the start of the wet - so we got rained on and then delayed 5 hours at a roadhouse on return due to flooded roads and fallen trees.. The company provided free food and drinks until a 4WD truck could come get us. It was quite the adventure and no fault of the company who were fabulous in handling the situation.
The rock art and landscape were amazing - but you’d get a lot more out of it over 2-3 days.",The rock art and landscape were amazing - but youd get a lot more out of it over 2-3 days.,experience,positive
Kakadu National Park,4.0,"Came to collect endangered animals, stayed for the nice views. Word on the town was that the near-extinct Palos Verdes Blue Butterfly was flying in for Winter hibernation in the mangrove trees of the park. I've been in the business for a long time, so I was one of the first to capitalize on this by taking the first available flight I could find down to Kakadu International Airport.

While I only saw a few instances of the butterfly, I can definitely vouch for the incredible atmosphere and surreal vistas of the park. I would've rated this location five stars had I not collected only forty pairs of Palos Verdes wings, leading to me just barely breaking even on the cost of the flights.

Key Vacation Details
- Visited in the last week of August 2022.
- Max temperature was 36 degrees daily. The heat was the most challenging but we managed.
- Due to the heat, I recommend exploring outdoor sites in the early morning (approx 630am - 1130am) and late arvo (from 4pm)
- Flies were around, but manageable. Minimal mozzies which weren't noticeable.
- 2WD Rav4
- 4 nights, 5 days
- Split trip bw Jabiru and Cooinda
- Stocked up on a lot food, dry snacks and water at Coles near Darwin Airport. This came in handy.

Experience Details
- Most people are standoffish and unfriendly. The customer service is below average. Suggest having low expectations.
- Food and accom are very expensive due to limited options
- A lot of the signage, facilities and accom are run down and need a refurbish",Kakadu is a special and incredible place.,other,positive

- Due to the heat, I recommend exploring outdoor sites in the early morning (approx 630am - 1130am) and late arvo (from 4pm)
- Flies were around, but manageable. Minimal mozzies which weren't noticeable.
- 2WD Rav4
- 4 nights, 5 days
- Split trip bw Jabiru and Cooinda
- Stocked up on a lot food, dry snacks and water at Coles near Darwin Airport. This came in handy.

Experience Details
- Most people are standoffish and unfriendly. The customer service is below average. Suggest having low expectations.
- Food and accom are very expensive due to limited options
- A lot of the signage, facilities and accom are run down and need a refurbish","- Food and accom are very expensive due to limited options - A lot of the signage, facilities and accom are run down and need a refurbish","price, signage, food",negative
Kakadu National Park,4.0,"Lovely National Park with great attractions particularly if you like walking/ hiking. The walks ranged in difficulty from easy to difficult but each track had good information at the start so you can judge your ability to complete it. The rock art sites were the highlight for us. Such wonderful examples well preserved with good explanations.  The visitor centres around about Kakadu need to be better informed as we ( and we heard same from others) got erroneous information about camping in the park and where to get camp passes from (both Katherine and Bowali) visitor centres.

Kakadu National Park,4.0,"So much to see and do I took off one star as the road conditions of the dirt roads was horrendous.

The road to Jim Jim falls was the worst road I have ever driven on (I spent 10 years driving to remote areas of NT and WA) I can't go lower than 4 stars though as what's at the end is great, do not bother with twin falls unless you are prepared to not actually see twin falls it's a hard steep trek to the top of the escarpment great view then a rough track to the top of the falls but you can't actually see the falls.

Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,4.0,"We had a fantastic stay in the glamping tent! We’d seen a few reviews mentioning that the food was overpriced, but we have to disagree — those comments felt a bit unfair in our experience. That said, we only dined at the onsite restaurant, Mini’s, and didn’t try the casual dining section, so perhaps those reviews were referring to that instead.

As for Mini’s, we can only speak highly of it. Over our two-night stay, we had some of the best meals of our entire NT trip. The service was exceptional — the staff were genuinely attentive, asked for feedback on new dishes, remembered our names, and even gave us great tips for places to visit the next day.

We tried all the available mains and loved them, especially the cauliflower, buffalo, and barramundi. Breakfast was just as impressive, with a great variety and some of the best coffee we had on the trip.

The tent itself was also fantastic. The bed was phenomenally comfortable — so much so that we even took note of the pillow brand because it was that good!

If there’s one clear area for improvement, it would be the landscaping and toilet access. We chose a tent without a private toilet, which was fine in theory, but the shared facilities were quite a walk away. There were no clear paths through the grounds, so we often found ourselves wandering around in the dark — sometimes at 1am — weaving through other tents on uneven, unpathed ground, surrounded by cane toads. It definitely took away from the otherwise relaxing experience and wasn’t ideal for guests being disturbed by others passing by at all hours. For the price of the stay, we do expect to have clear, easy access to the bathroom.

Overall, we loved our stay and would absolutely recommend it, but a few improvements around the grounds (i.e boardwalk to amenities) could make a big difference!",We had a fantastic stay in the glamping tent!,other,positive

The tent itself was also fantastic. The bed was phenomenally comfortable — so much so that we even took note of the pillow brand because it was that good!

If there’s one clear area for improvement, it would be the landscaping and toilet access. We chose a tent without a private toilet, which was fine in theory, but the shared facilities were quite a walk away. There were no clear paths through the grounds, so we often found ourselves wandering around in the dark — sometimes at 1am — weaving through other tents on uneven, unpathed ground, surrounded by cane toads. It definitely took away from the otherwise relaxing experience and wasn’t ideal for guests being disturbed by others passing by at all hours. For the price of the stay, we do expect to have clear, easy access to the bathroom.

Overall, we loved our stay and would absolutely recommend it, but a few improvements around the grounds (i.e boardwalk to amenities) could make a big difference!",The tent itself was also fantastic.,other,positive

We’d seen a few reviews mentioning that the food was overpriced, but we have to disagree — those comments felt a bit unfair in our experience. That said, we only dined at the onsite restaurant, Mini’s, and didn’t try the casual dining section, so perhaps those reviews were referring to that instead.

Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,4.0,"We stayed for 4 nights in one of the motel style rooms. We had an excellent time! Our room was very clean and well maintained. The room was also quite spacious and had a patio with furniture. The only downside was the bathroom was not spacious - a smaller corner shower cubicle with rainfall shower head, although new and quite nice. I happen to have a personal loathing of rainfall shower heads as they make washing more difficult for me.
The bed was extremely comfortable and the air con was on when we arrived, which is always appreciated.

The grounds of the resort are gorgeous - and all very flat which made it much easier for this disabled traveller.

The buffet breakfast was standard stuff, but all well prepared and fresh. Extra points for having perfectly poached eggs available.

Service from everyone was friendly and attentive. We ate in both the restaurant and the bistro and both were good. It was nice to have some better salad and fresh food options after a lengthy roadtrip through the outback where I had found myself craving fresh fruit and lightly cooked vegetables instead of chips and burgers (although both of these were available and very tasty). Bistro portions were very generous. Restaurant portions were more fine dining size, but a shared entree, a main each and a shared side was enough for dinner for us - if you're hungry definitely have three courses.

We did both the sunset and dawn yellow waters cruises. Dennis and Jess were both excellent - Dennis has a fantastic, dry sense of humour and tells great stories! From a disability access perspective, they gave me a lift on the buggy to the dock which was helpful - good to know they can if anyone travelling is a bit frail. All photos attached to this review are from the cruise. It's an extra cost but a must-do and takes off right from the resort - from home dock at the resort in wet season as the main dock is underwater. In a few weeks the take off will be a short bus trip away from the resort as the water goes.

The cruise itself was spectacular - with everything still quite wet, it was just incredible to see endless waters reflecting the sky. Even though early April is still pretty quiet for wildlife, we saw saltwater crocodiles and a lovely array of bird life! I am very sure I could happily spend months out on the water watching the seasons change.

The main pool at the resort is lovely too! It has a ramp that is a bit on the step end (pool is older than current access standards), but still easier access for me than steps.

Being in Kakadu at this time of year means that we're of course in a hot, humid and remote environment. When holidaying in the area, bring lots of water, a big hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and a lot of bug spray - you may be eaten alive regardless. I saw most tourists wearing shorts sleeves - but you are actually much better off wearing long sleeves, for both sun and bug protection. Have a look at what most tour operators are wearing - long sleeve breathable fabrics like cotton are the way :)

Highly recommend Cooinda Lodge. It's in an iconic location, the team are excellent and we finished our 4 nights happy, relaxed, energized and in awe of the incredible natural and cultural wonder that is Kakadu.",We stayed for 4 nights in one of the motel style rooms.,facility,neutral

I happen to have a personal loathing of rainfall shower heads as they make washing more difficult for me.
The bed was extremely comfortable and the air con was on when we arrived, which is always appreciated.

The grounds of the resort are gorgeous - and all very flat which made it much easier for this disabled traveller.

The buffet breakfast was standard stuff, but all well prepared and fresh. Extra points for having perfectly poached eggs available.

Service from everyone was friendly and attentive. We ate in both the restaurant and the bistro and both were good. It was nice to have some better salad and fresh food options after a lengthy roadtrip through the outback where I had found myself craving fresh fruit and lightly cooked vegetables instead of chips and burgers (although both of these were available and very tasty). Bistro portions were very generous. Restaurant portions were more fine dining size, but a shared entree, a main each and a shared side was enough for dinner for us - if you're hungry definitely have three courses.

We did both the sunset and dawn yellow waters cruises. Dennis and Jess were both excellent - Dennis has a fantastic, dry sense of humour and tells great stories! From a disability access perspective, they gave me a lift on the buggy to the dock which was helpful - good to know they can if anyone travelling is a bit frail. All photos attached to this review are from the cruise. It's an extra cost but a must-do and takes off right from the resort - from home dock at the resort in wet season as the main dock is underwater. In a few weeks the take off will be a short bus trip away from the resort as the water goes.

The cruise itself was spectacular - with everything still quite wet, it was just incredible to see endless waters reflecting the sky. Even though early April is still pretty quiet for wildlife, we saw saltwater crocodiles and a lovely array of bird life! I am very sure I could happily spend months out on the water watching the seasons change.

The main pool at the resort is lovely too! It has a ramp that is a bit on the step end (pool is older than current access standards), but still easier access for me than steps.

Being in Kakadu at this time of year means that we're of course in a hot, humid and remote environment. When holidaying in the area, bring lots of water, a big hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and a lot of bug spray - you may be eaten alive regardless. I saw most tourists wearing shorts sleeves - but you are actually much better off wearing long sleeves, for both sun and bug protection. Have a look at what most tour operators are wearing - long sleeve breathable fabrics like cotton are the way :)

Highly recommend Cooinda Lodge. It's in an iconic location, the team are excellent and we finished our 4 nights happy, relaxed, energized and in awe of the incredible natural and cultural wonder that is Kakadu.","The only downside was the bathroom was not spacious - a smaller corner shower cubicle with rainfall shower head, although new and quite nice.","facility, experience, environment",positive

The room was also quite spacious and had a patio with furniture. The only downside was the bathroom was not spacious - a smaller corner shower cubicle with rainfall shower head, although new and quite nice. I happen to have a personal loathing of rainfall shower heads as they make washing more difficult for me.
The bed was extremely comfortable and the air con was on when we arrived, which is always appreciated.

The grounds of the resort are gorgeous - and all very flat which made it much easier for this disabled traveller.

The buffet breakfast was standard stuff, but all well prepared and fresh. Extra points for having perfectly poached eggs available.

Service from everyone was friendly and attentive. We ate in both the restaurant and the bistro and both were good. It was nice to have some better salad and fresh food options after a lengthy roadtrip through the outback where I had found myself craving fresh fruit and lightly cooked vegetables instead of chips and burgers (although both of these were available and very tasty). Bistro portions were very generous. Restaurant portions were more fine dining size, but a shared entree, a main each and a shared side was enough for dinner for us - if you're hungry definitely have three courses.

We did both the sunset and dawn yellow waters cruises. Dennis and Jess were both excellent - Dennis has a fantastic, dry sense of humour and tells great stories! From a disability access perspective, they gave me a lift on the buggy to the dock which was helpful - good to know they can if anyone travelling is a bit frail. All photos attached to this review are from the cruise. It's an extra cost but a must-do and takes off right from the resort - from home dock at the resort in wet season as the main dock is underwater. In a few weeks the take off will be a short bus trip away from the resort as the water goes.

The cruise itself was spectacular - with everything still quite wet, it was just incredible to see endless waters reflecting the sky. Even though early April is still pretty quiet for wildlife, we saw saltwater crocodiles and a lovely array of bird life! I am very sure I could happily spend months out on the water watching the seasons change.

The main pool at the resort is lovely too! It has a ramp that is a bit on the step end (pool is older than current access standards), but still easier access for me than steps.

Being in Kakadu at this time of year means that we're of course in a hot, humid and remote environment. When holidaying in the area, bring lots of water, a big hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and a lot of bug spray - you may be eaten alive regardless. I saw most tourists wearing shorts sleeves - but you are actually much better off wearing long sleeves, for both sun and bug protection. Have a look at what most tour operators are wearing - long sleeve breathable fabrics like cotton are the way :)

Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,4.0,"We stayed for 4 nights in one of the motel style rooms. We had an excellent time! Our room was very clean and well maintained. The room was also quite spacious and had a patio with furniture. The only downside was the bathroom was not spacious - a smaller corner shower cubicle with rainfall shower head, although new and quite nice. I happen to have a personal loathing of rainfall shower heads as they make washing more difficult for me.
The bed was extremely comfortable and the air con was on when we arrived, which is always appreciated.

The grounds of the resort are gorgeous - and all very flat which made it much easier for this disabled traveller.

The buffet breakfast was standard stuff, but all well prepared and fresh. Extra points for having perfectly poached eggs available.

Service from everyone was friendly and attentive. We ate in both the restaurant and the bistro and both were good. It was nice to have some better salad and fresh food options after a lengthy roadtrip through the outback where I had found myself craving fresh fruit and lightly cooked vegetables instead of chips and burgers (although both of these were available and very tasty). Bistro portions were very generous. Restaurant portions were more fine dining size, but a shared entree, a main each and a shared side was enough for dinner for us - if you're hungry definitely have three courses.

We did both the sunset and dawn yellow waters cruises. Dennis and Jess were both excellent - Dennis has a fantastic, dry sense of humour and tells great stories! From a disability access perspective, they gave me a lift on the buggy to the dock which was helpful - good to know they can if anyone travelling is a bit frail. All photos attached to this review are from the cruise. It's an extra cost but a must-do and takes off right from the resort - from home dock at the resort in wet season as the main dock is underwater. In a few weeks the take off will be a short bus trip away from the resort as the water goes.

The cruise itself was spectacular - with everything still quite wet, it was just incredible to see endless waters reflecting the sky. Even though early April is still pretty quiet for wildlife, we saw saltwater crocodiles and a lovely array of bird life! I am very sure I could happily spend months out on the water watching the seasons change.

The main pool at the resort is lovely too! It has a ramp that is a bit on the step end (pool is older than current access standards), but still easier access for me than steps.

Being in Kakadu at this time of year means that we're of course in a hot, humid and remote environment. When holidaying in the area, bring lots of water, a big hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and a lot of bug spray - you may be eaten alive regardless. I saw most tourists wearing shorts sleeves - but you are actually much better off wearing long sleeves, for both sun and bug protection.

Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,4.0,"I really loved the convenience of Cooinda Lodge! We stayed in a lodge room. It is a teeny bit cramped for 4 people with queen and two singles (we sat around on our beds) but it's not an issue if you're out all day walking, sightseeing or in the pool. It certainly didn't bother us, and I did really like the kakadu botanicals in the bathroom!

The best part is getting to the yellow water cruises which is right outside so I don't have to drag myself at early hours in the car there.

Being close to the water you will have lots of bugs so don't leave your doors open with the lights on!

So many eating options to choose from and they aren't super cheap but I don't expect that for the middle of a national park. Fuel here as well, a store with food, camping and fishing gear.

I would stay again, and all the staff were lovely.",I really loved the convenience of Cooinda Lodge!,other,positive

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,4.0,"Part of a road trip around the top of NT was a stop in Kakadu, and specifically the massive metropolis that is Jabiru.
Now, when staying in crocodile country, what better place to stay that a building constructed in the representative manner of a crocodile.
Whilst I waited in that car, my wife ventured inside to check in. It wasn't until later that I entered the space that is the check in area, come shop, come art gallery.
Check in quick and efficient, with quick info on best coffee in town, when the supermarket is open and how much there isn't to do around what is a very small gathering of caravan parks, a petrol station, art gallery and a few other shops ( and I do mean a few). But I digress.
Car parked in one of the three round carparks (represents crocodile eggs) and a very short walk to our ground floor room. There is a first floor ( or second if you're American or cannot count properly).
All rooms open onto the central courtyard - either looking at water features or another water feature, the pool. We're poor so we were in a standard room. Yep, it was standard, with a nice supportive bed, and great pillows. Look the older and more broken you get, the more a good pillow makes up for some other deficiencies.
It's an old hotel, that has had a few updates, but look around and you'll see the age of the joint. It may be different in more expensive rooms, but it felt like a classic Ferrari - looks great from a distance, but it's worn out and needs a proper going over to sort the dodgy fixes, suss paint job and dodgy air con.
Pillows aside (have I said, they're great pillows) the rooms are big, well, mine was. The bathroom was the old hotel shower over small bath type. With the need for a plastic suction mat in the bottom of the bath ( the same sort your nan uses to prevent slippage and mass limb fractures). And because personal hygiene requires problem solving, a shower curtain that doesn't quite close the gaps up, so water goes everywhere - especially if your my wife.
The water also never really got above tepid. Which as it was bloody hot, was not a great loss. In fact, woke me up every time I had a wash.
The room was built of plain blocks over painted, well some of it. For some reason the ceiling had bubbled and blistering paint. My guess was moisture - leak or poor cooling. Which may have been a reason for a dehumidifier or similar small appliance that was plugged in and rattling away whilst we stayed. At least it would have done so, if it didn't break down with flashing icons all over its control pad.
And whilst we're looking up, there's a fan/light contraption that is not centrally located and works off a seperate remote to all other light controls. Feels like an addition done cheaply to help the air con, which struggled. God knows what it's like in the wet season?
Plenty of power points, unlike some of the other abodes we stayed in.
Sometimes, there's a ""what the"" moment when your on holiday, and this was when I went to the patio doors. Locked with a flip lock, then added safety chain, and a large sign that advises/tells you to keep doors locked at all times. Very reassuring to know that it's more dangerous than a walking holiday through Mexican border towns. Feels like a bit of a theme in areas travelled to in the region.
Now, by reading the above you'd think I was down on the croc hotel. Nope, forget the paint, rotten skirting boards and zombie proof doors, it's a good place to stay.
The restaurant was visited on one night, and although I'd read some reviews saying the buffet was awful, we choose it. Can't be certain, but it's offered when large tour groups book in.
All the food was good, with the curry being an absolute stunner. As it's a buffet, you can gorge yourself until you can't stuff in anymore. I didn't rate the desserts though - bit sweet and a bit samey for my tastes.
To make life just a little more relaxed, I had a cocktail - again Long Island Iced Tea wins value for money.

It may be different in more expensive rooms, but it felt like a classic Ferrari - looks great from a distance, but it's worn out and needs a proper going over to sort the dodgy fixes, suss paint job and dodgy air con.
Pillows aside (have I said, they're great pillows) the rooms are big, well, mine was. The bathroom was the old hotel shower over small bath type. With the need for a plastic suction mat in the bottom of the bath ( the same sort your nan uses to prevent slippage and mass limb fractures). And because personal hygiene requires problem solving, a shower curtain that doesn't quite close the gaps up, so water goes everywhere - especially if your my wife.
The water also never really got above tepid. Which as it was bloody hot, was not a great loss. In fact, woke me up every time I had a wash.
The room was built of plain blocks over painted, well some of it. For some reason the ceiling had bubbled and blistering paint. My guess was moisture - leak or poor cooling. Which may have been a reason for a dehumidifier or similar small appliance that was plugged in and rattling away whilst we stayed. At least it would have done so, if it didn't break down with flashing icons all over its control pad.
And whilst we're looking up, there's a fan/light contraption that is not centrally located and works off a seperate remote to all other light controls. Feels like an addition done cheaply to help the air con, which struggled. God knows what it's like in the wet season?
Plenty of power points, unlike some of the other abodes we stayed in.
Sometimes, there's a ""what the"" moment when your on holiday, and this was when I went to the patio doors. Locked with a flip lock, then added safety chain, and a large sign that advises/tells you to keep doors locked at all times. Very reassuring to know that it's more dangerous than a walking holiday through Mexican border towns. Feels like a bit of a theme in areas travelled to in the region.
Now, by reading the above you'd think I was down on the croc hotel. Nope, forget the paint, rotten skirting boards and zombie proof doors, it's a good place to stay.
The restaurant was visited on one night, and although I'd read some reviews saying the buffet was awful, we choose it. Can't be certain, but it's offered when large tour groups book in.
All the food was good, with the curry being an absolute stunner. As it's a buffet, you can gorge yourself until you can't stuff in anymore. I didn't rate the desserts though - bit sweet and a bit samey for my tastes.
To make life just a little more relaxed, I had a cocktail - again Long Island Iced Tea wins value for money.

With the need for a plastic suction mat in the bottom of the bath ( the same sort your nan uses to prevent slippage and mass limb fractures). And because personal hygiene requires problem solving, a shower curtain that doesn't quite close the gaps up, so water goes everywhere - especially if your my wife.
The water also never really got above tepid. Which as it was bloody hot, was not a great loss. In fact, woke me up every time I had a wash.
The room was built of plain blocks over painted, well some of it. For some reason the ceiling had bubbled and blistering paint. My guess was moisture - leak or poor cooling. Which may have been a reason for a dehumidifier or similar small appliance that was plugged in and rattling away whilst we stayed. At least it would have done so, if it didn't break down with flashing icons all over its control pad.
And whilst we're looking up, there's a fan/light contraption that is not centrally located and works off a seperate remote to all other light controls. Feels like an addition done cheaply to help the air con, which struggled. God knows what it's like in the wet season?

Now, by reading the above you'd think I was down on the croc hotel. Nope, forget the paint, rotten skirting boards and zombie proof doors, it's a good place to stay.
The restaurant was visited on one night, and although I'd read some reviews saying the buffet was awful, we choose it. Can't be certain, but it's offered when large tour groups book in.
All the food was good, with the curry being an absolute stunner. As it's a buffet, you can gorge yourself until you can't stuff in anymore. I didn't rate the desserts though - bit sweet and a bit samey for my tastes.
To make life just a little more relaxed, I had a cocktail - again Long Island Iced Tea wins value for money.

And because personal hygiene requires problem solving, a shower curtain that doesn't quite close the gaps up, so water goes everywhere - especially if your my wife.
The water also never really got above tepid. Which as it was bloody hot, was not a great loss. In fact, woke me up every time I had a wash.
The room was built of plain blocks over painted, well some of it. For some reason the ceiling had bubbled and blistering paint. My guess was moisture - leak or poor cooling. Which may have been a reason for a dehumidifier or similar small appliance that was plugged in and rattling away whilst we stayed. At least it would have done so, if it didn't break down with flashing icons all over its control pad.
And whilst we're looking up, there's a fan/light contraption that is not centrally located and works off a seperate remote to all other light controls. Feels like an addition done cheaply to help the air con, which struggled. God knows what it's like in the wet season?
Plenty of power points, unlike some of the other abodes we stayed in.
Sometimes, there's a ""what the"" moment when your on holiday, and this was when I went to the patio doors. Locked with a flip lock, then added safety chain, and a large sign that advises/tells you to keep doors locked at all times. Very reassuring to know that it's more dangerous than a walking holiday through Mexican border towns. Feels like a bit of a theme in areas travelled to in the region.
Now, by reading the above you'd think I was down on the croc hotel. Nope, forget the paint, rotten skirting boards and zombie proof doors, it's a good place to stay.
The restaurant was visited on one night, and although I'd read some reviews saying the buffet was awful, we choose it. Can't be certain, but it's offered when large tour groups book in.
All the food was good, with the curry being an absolute stunner. As it's a buffet, you can gorge yourself until you can't stuff in anymore. I didn't rate the desserts though - bit sweet and a bit samey for my tastes.
To make life just a little more relaxed, I had a cocktail - again Long Island Iced Tea wins value for money.

Now, when staying in crocodile country, what better place to stay that a building constructed in the representative manner of a crocodile.
Whilst I waited in that car, my wife ventured inside to check in. It wasn't until later that I entered the space that is the check in area, come shop, come art gallery.
Check in quick and efficient, with quick info on best coffee in town, when the supermarket is open and how much there isn't to do around what is a very small gathering of caravan parks, a petrol station, art gallery and a few other shops ( and I do mean a few). But I digress.
Car parked in one of the three round carparks (represents crocodile eggs) and a very short walk to our ground floor room. There is a first floor ( or second if you're American or cannot count properly).
All rooms open onto the central courtyard - either looking at water features or another water feature, the pool. We're poor so we were in a standard room. Yep, it was standard, with a nice supportive bed, and great pillows. Look the older and more broken you get, the more a good pillow makes up for some other deficiencies.
It's an old hotel, that has had a few updates, but look around and you'll see the age of the joint. It may be different in more expensive rooms, but it felt like a classic Ferrari - looks great from a distance, but it's worn out and needs a proper going over to sort the dodgy fixes, suss paint job and dodgy air con.

Which may have been a reason for a dehumidifier or similar small appliance that was plugged in and rattling away whilst we stayed. At least it would have done so, if it didn't break down with flashing icons all over its control pad.
And whilst we're looking up, there's a fan/light contraption that is not centrally located and works off a seperate remote to all other light controls. Feels like an addition done cheaply to help the air con, which struggled. God knows what it's like in the wet season?
Plenty of power points, unlike some of the other abodes we stayed in.

Locked with a flip lock, then added safety chain, and a large sign that advises/tells you to keep doors locked at all times. Very reassuring to know that it's more dangerous than a walking holiday through Mexican border towns. Feels like a bit of a theme in areas travelled to in the region.
Now, by reading the above you'd think I was down on the croc hotel. Nope, forget the paint, rotten skirting boards and zombie proof doors, it's a good place to stay.
The restaurant was visited on one night, and although I'd read some reviews saying the buffet was awful, we choose it. Can't be certain, but it's offered when large tour groups book in.
All the food was good, with the curry being an absolute stunner. As it's a buffet, you can gorge yourself until you can't stuff in anymore. I didn't rate the desserts though - bit sweet and a bit samey for my tastes.
To make life just a little more relaxed, I had a cocktail - again Long Island Iced Tea wins value for money.

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,4.0,"Part of a road trip around the top of NT was a stop in Kakadu, and specifically the massive metropolis that is Jabiru.
Now, when staying in crocodile country, what better place to stay that a building constructed in the representative manner of a crocodile.
Whilst I waited in that car, my wife ventured inside to check in. It wasn't until later that I entered the space that is the check in area, come shop, come art gallery.
Check in quick and efficient, with quick info on best coffee in town, when the supermarket is open and how much there isn't to do around what is a very small gathering of caravan parks, a petrol station, art gallery and a few other shops ( and I do mean a few). But I digress.
Car parked in one of the three round carparks (represents crocodile eggs) and a very short walk to our ground floor room. There is a first floor ( or second if you're American or cannot count properly).
All rooms open onto the central courtyard - either looking at water features or another water feature, the pool. We're poor so we were in a standard room. Yep, it was standard, with a nice supportive bed, and great pillows. Look the older and more broken you get, the more a good pillow makes up for some other deficiencies.
It's an old hotel, that has had a few updates, but look around and you'll see the age of the joint. It may be different in more expensive rooms, but it felt like a classic Ferrari - looks great from a distance, but it's worn out and needs a proper going over to sort the dodgy fixes, suss paint job and dodgy air con.
Pillows aside (have I said, they're great pillows) the rooms are big, well, mine was. The bathroom was the old hotel shower over small bath type. With the need for a plastic suction mat in the bottom of the bath ( the same sort your nan uses to prevent slippage and mass limb fractures). And because personal hygiene requires problem solving, a shower curtain that doesn't quite close the gaps up, so water goes everywhere - especially if your my wife.

And whilst we're looking up, there's a fan/light contraption that is not centrally located and works off a seperate remote to all other light controls. Feels like an addition done cheaply to help the air con, which struggled. God knows what it's like in the wet season?
Plenty of power points, unlike some of the other abodes we stayed in.
Sometimes, there's a ""what the"" moment when your on holiday, and this was when I went to the patio doors. Locked with a flip lock, then added safety chain, and a large sign that advises/tells you to keep doors locked at all times. Very reassuring to know that it's more dangerous than a walking holiday through Mexican border towns. Feels like a bit of a theme in areas travelled to in the region.
Now, by reading the above you'd think I was down on the croc hotel. Nope, forget the paint, rotten skirting boards and zombie proof doors, it's a good place to stay.
The restaurant was visited on one night, and although I'd read some reviews saying the buffet was awful, we choose it. Can't be certain, but it's offered when large tour groups book in.
All the food was good, with the curry being an absolute stunner. As it's a buffet, you can gorge yourself until you can't stuff in anymore. I didn't rate the desserts though - bit sweet and a bit samey for my tastes.
To make life just a little more relaxed, I had a cocktail - again Long Island Iced Tea wins value for money.

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,4.0,"Part of a road trip around the top of NT was a stop in Kakadu, and specifically the massive metropolis that is Jabiru.
Now, when staying in crocodile country, what better place to stay that a building constructed in the representative manner of a crocodile.
Whilst I waited in that car, my wife ventured inside to check in. It wasn't until later that I entered the space that is the check in area, come shop, come art gallery.
Check in quick and efficient, with quick info on best coffee in town, when the supermarket is open and how much there isn't to do around what is a very small gathering of caravan parks, a petrol station, art gallery and a few other shops ( and I do mean a few). But I digress.
Car parked in one of the three round carparks (represents crocodile eggs) and a very short walk to our ground floor room. There is a first floor ( or second if you're American or cannot count properly).
All rooms open onto the central courtyard - either looking at water features or another water feature, the pool. We're poor so we were in a standard room. Yep, it was standard, with a nice supportive bed, and great pillows. Look the older and more broken you get, the more a good pillow makes up for some other deficiencies.
It's an old hotel, that has had a few updates, but look around and you'll see the age of the joint. It may be different in more expensive rooms, but it felt like a classic Ferrari - looks great from a distance, but it's worn out and needs a proper going over to sort the dodgy fixes, suss paint job and dodgy air con.
Pillows aside (have I said, they're great pillows) the rooms are big, well, mine was. The bathroom was the old hotel shower over small bath type. With the need for a plastic suction mat in the bottom of the bath ( the same sort your nan uses to prevent slippage and mass limb fractures). And because personal hygiene requires problem solving, a shower curtain that doesn't quite close the gaps up, so water goes everywhere - especially if your my wife.
The water also never really got above tepid. Which as it was bloody hot, was not a great loss. In fact, woke me up every time I had a wash.
The room was built of plain blocks over painted, well some of it. For some reason the ceiling had bubbled and blistering paint. My guess was moisture - leak or poor cooling. Which may have been a reason for a dehumidifier or similar small appliance that was plugged in and rattling away whilst we stayed.

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,4.0,"Stayed one night. At dinner, the wait staff couldn’t pronounce my husbands name, and seemingly refused to understand him when he spoke. His Aussie accent is not that thick!

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,4.0,"Obviously, this hotel is all about the shape and it works quite well, although you would need to view it from the air to see it properly. The reception, restaurant and bar are all in the head of the 'crocodile', whilst the rooms make up the outer edges of the body. The legs are stairs to the upper floor.
We arrived as part of a group tour and our reception was really well organised, distributing the keys and given instruction where to make reservations for dinner and then on to our room.
Our room was very spacious with an additional seating area with a table and chairs, which could be used for dining at if you wanted to bring food in from elsewhere (there is a supermarket just a short walk from the hotel). Being on the ground floor our room opened out onto the very pleasant gardens in the centre of the hotel, which in turn lead to the swimming pool. The bathroom did have a shower over bath, which is probably a bit dated now, but it was clean and perfectly serviceable.
The restaurant is quite spacious and although the service was a little slow, the food we had was very nice.","Obviously, this hotel is all about the shape and it works quite well, although you would need to view it from the air to see it properly.",environment,positive

Only thing I could suggest is maybe having Chromecast compatible TVs, so guests can watch their own shows whilst relaxing.

It is a bit steeply priced, but easy to forget that when you're hanging out at the Lagoon pool!

Mindil Beach Casino Resort,4.0,"Lovely location with tired and dated accommodation .

We loved the view from our room, and I loved the proximity to Bass in the Grass.

The TV in our room was faulty the picture faded to a black patch in the LH corner, it wasn’t replaced during our 5 night stay.

There was no sound on the F1 channel which for us was worse than not having the channel at all.  The apparent reason for this was our room didn’t actually have Foxtel which I think is either strange or a massive mistake on the Resort’s behalf as the rooms aren’t cheap.

// Back at the market before leaving Darwin tomorrow. We got there around 6 pm and spent about 20 minutes finding a parking spot—definitely come early if you’re driving!

The Sunday crowd was much bigger compared to Thursday when we first visited. Tried the pork stick (AUD 6) after a long queue—super fatty, juicy, and very salty..

Also grabbed the garlic butter corn cob (AUD 9), and it was amazing! The vendor asked if we wanted salt, I said no, and it was still delicious. Highly recommend eating the corn while it’s hot!

// Came to the market around 4+ and it was already crowded. There’s a wide variety of food — from Chinese to Thai, Mexican, Japanese, Korean and more. We settled for a kebab and a bowl of chicken laksa.

The kebab was really good at AUD15. The flatbread was crispy, generously filled with chicken, and the mix of ingredients inside made it delicious.

The chicken laksa was less impressive. Coming from Singapore, I found it weak in flavor compared to our spicier version. The Darwin version was sweeter, with a strong coconut taste. It had so much chicken that I could hardly find the noodles.

For dessert, I tried the churros in the “must-try” Lotus flavor. It didn’t seem freshly made and wasn’t as crispy as expected. Lotus is definitely sweet — I probably clocked my sugar intake for the whole year with that dessert.

I also got 10% off for paying cash at the Laska stall. Credit cards are widely accepted but come with a 1.6–1.9% surcharge, so cash is a better option, even though I usually prefer going cashless.",28 Sep 2025 // Back at the market before leaving Darwin tomorrow.,other,neutral

Also grabbed the garlic butter corn cob (AUD 9), and it was amazing! The vendor asked if we wanted salt, I said no, and it was still delicious. Highly recommend eating the corn while it’s hot!

// Came to the market around 4+ and it was already crowded. There’s a wide variety of food — from Chinese to Thai, Mexican, Japanese, Korean and more. We settled for a kebab and a bowl of chicken laksa.

The kebab was really good at AUD15. The flatbread was crispy, generously filled with chicken, and the mix of ingredients inside made it delicious.

The chicken laksa was less impressive. Coming from Singapore, I found it weak in flavor compared to our spicier version. The Darwin version was sweeter, with a strong coconut taste. It had so much chicken that I could hardly find the noodles.

For dessert, I tried the churros in the “must-try” Lotus flavor. It didn’t seem freshly made and wasn’t as crispy as expected. Lotus is definitely sweet — I probably clocked my sugar intake for the whole year with that dessert.

I also got 10% off for paying cash at the Laska stall. Credit cards are widely accepted but come with a 1.6–1.9% surcharge, so cash is a better option, even though I usually prefer going cashless.","The Darwin version was sweeter, with a strong coconut taste.",other,positive

Sunset was utterly breathtaking- the canvas of sky was painted in gorgeous hues over the course of a mere half hour. Public restrooms are available!

Mindil Beach Sunset Market,4.0,"Yes, the crowds are something else but the sunset is sublime too ✨️✨️ Easy to get here by free city bus service from bus stop near Hilton Hotel on Mitchell St & return from where you get off. Seasonal night market open Thurs & Sun evenings from April to Oct - check website for details. Insect Repellent a must - spray on before you get here.

Live music, camel rides, minor rides for kids,  quality craft & ubiquitous food stalls abound. Book table setting at Sunset Lounge to have your stall purchased meals & drinks with friends wayyy ahead! Or lug your beach chairs & picnic mats. Tables are fully occupied near the live band area early.

As for picking the right food stall - the queues are the indicator . I had seafood paella which was not bad & huge qty for $23. There's Mexican, Italian, fish + chips etc as well as the many Asian street food to pick from. The sorbet & ice-cream stalls are  - pick the smaller one with a youngish girl - 3 fresh flavours for $7.

I found my halcyon quietude on the beach before sunset at 6.30 pm on Thurs 24/7 recently - the crowds were there around me but hey! Be in the moment & block it out. Left the company of my friends to enjoy the vivid hues of NT sunset alone on the warm sand, hoping that a carelessly discarded fork won't stab me! Let alone some random croc or stingers as the sign on beach warns..lol..Toilets are on either end of market. Onsite parking but public transport is best.

Do donate to the chatty indigenous man providing backdrop chant & stick tapping sounds which added NT vibes to the sunset show..

Crocosaurus Cove,4.0,"A fun experience, seeing some local reptiles as well as the crocodiles! I visited about 12 years ago and this place seemed exactly the same. We didn’t have long, so listened to a “meet the reptiles” chat by a keeper and did the “croc fishing” experience with the juveniles. The last time I visited I also held the baby croc.

Lost a star because the aquarium with fish, turtles and Sting rays could be .... cleaner? Brighter? It's pretty dark and I'm not sure what can be done with that. It's the first exhibit you come across and it should be more of a WoW factor.
The crocs are *huge*, the ""cage of death"" looks fun (if the croc doesn't move in the enclosure they will move you around to another pen. 'Will' was the winner for today and put on a good. Cage of Death has a time frame of 15mins for $195 (single occupant).
The reptile house is amazing and when we walked through there was lovely young Lady with a snake and Blue Tounge Lizard ""Steven"" that you can hold. These guys are really chilled and there were a few younger kids before us that got to hold them, and waved them through the air and chased their siblings around with them and they didn't seemed phased.
Take your bathers, there's a little swimming pool you can take a dip in - the lost star includes this pool - it was filled with leaves and a bit neglected. Could do with a clean as you kick up the silt on the bottom and can't get a good photo of the crocs 'swimming' beside you (swimming with the crocs ).
There is a little Cafe on the 2nd floor and some tables and chairs to chillaxe at. The staff are knowledgeable and friendly.

Crocosaurus Cove,4.0,"We had a wonderful time at this delightful place! The environment was fun, and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. We even got the unique opportunity to hold a crocodile and a snake, and fed the crocs—definitely memorable moments during our stay in Darwin.

However, there was a bit of affecting the mood with one of the staff members who kept reminding us not to photograph the participants diving with the ""Cage of Death"" crocs. Respecting her wishes, I focused my photos on the crocodiles themselves and carefully avoiding the participants. Despite this, two staff members stand close to me, staring at me and discussing something like, ""I have told him!"" in a manner that felt somewhat dismissive.

I understand the importance of their guidelines and although I am a tourist I understand English well and knew that they were discussing me indeed.

Kakadu National Park,5.0,"Kakadu National Park is a protected area in the Northern Territory of Australia, 171 km (106 mi) southeast of Darwin. It is a World Heritage Site. Kakadu is also gazetted as a locality, covering the same area as the national park, with 313 people recorded living there in the 2016 Australian census.

Kakadu National Park is located within the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory, covering an area of 19,804 km2 (7,646 sq mi), extending nearly 200 kilometres (124 mi) from north to south and over 100 kilometres (62 mi) from east to west. It is roughly the size of Wales or one-third the size of Tasmania, and is the second-largest national park in Australia, after the Munga-Thirri–Simpson Desert National Park. Most of the region is owned by the Aboriginal traditional owners, who have occupied the land for around 60,000 years and, today, manage the park jointly with Parks Australia. It is highly ecologically and biologically diverse, hosting a wide range of habitats and flora and fauna. It also includes a rich heritage of Aboriginal rock art, including highly significant sites, such as Ubirr. Kakadu is fully protected by the EPBC Act.

Kakadu is a place of enormous ecological and biological diversity. It extends from the coast and estuaries in the north through floodplains, billabongs and lowlands to rocky ridges and stone country in the south. These landscapes are home to a range of rare and endemic plants and animals, including more than one-third of Australia's bird species and one-quarter of its freshwater and estuarine fish species.️

卡卡杜国家公园是澳大利亚北领地的一个保护区，位于达尔文东南171公里（106英里）。它是世界遗产。卡卡杜也被列为地方政府，其面积与国家公园相同。2016年澳大利亚人口普查记录显示，共有313人居住于此。

卡卡杜国家公园位于北领地的鳄鱼河地区，占地19,804平方公里（7,646平方英里），南北绵延近200公里（124英里），东西绵延超过100公里（62英里）。它的面积大约相当于威尔士，或塔斯马尼亚岛面积的三分之一，是澳大利亚第二大国家公园，仅次于蒙加-瑟里-辛普森沙漠国家公园。该地区大部分土地归原住民传统所有者所有，他们已在此居住约6万年，如今与澳大利亚公园管理局共同管理该公园。该地区生态和生物多样性极高，拥有种类繁多的栖息地和动植物。此外，这里还拥有丰富的原住民岩画遗产，其中包括乌比尔等意义非凡的遗址。卡卡杜受到《环境、生物多样性和生物多样性法案》的全面保护。

卡卡杜拥有丰富的生态和生物多样性。它从北部的海岸和河口，穿过洪泛平原、死水潭和低地，一直延伸到南部的岩石山脊和石林。这些景观是各种珍稀特有动植物的家园，其中包括超过三分之一的澳大利亚鸟类以及四分之一的淡水和河口鱼类。️","Kakadu National Park is a protected area in the Northern Territory of Australia, 171 km (106 mi) southeast of Darwin.",other,positive

卡卡杜拥有丰富的生态和生物多样性。它从北部的海岸和河口，穿过洪泛平原、死水潭和低地，一直延伸到南部的岩石山脊和石林。这些景观是各种珍稀特有动植物的家园，其中包括超过三分之一的澳大利亚鸟类以及四分之一的淡水和河口鱼类。️","These landscapes are home to a range of rare and endemic plants and animals, including more than one-third of Australia's bird species and one-quarter of its freshwater and estuarine fish species.",environment,neutral
Kakadu National Park,5.0,"Kakadu National Park is a protected area in the Northern Territory of Australia, 171 km (106 mi) southeast of Darwin. It is a World Heritage Site. Kakadu is also gazetted as a locality, covering the same area as the national park, with 313 people recorded living there in the 2016 Australian census.

Kakadu National Park is located within the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory, covering an area of 19,804 km2 (7,646 sq mi), extending nearly 200 kilometres (124 mi) from north to south and over 100 kilometres (62 mi) from east to west. It is roughly the size of Wales or one-third the size of Tasmania, and is the second-largest national park in Australia, after the Munga-Thirri–Simpson Desert National Park. Most of the region is owned by the Aboriginal traditional owners, who have occupied the land for around 60,000 years and, today, manage the park jointly with Parks Australia. It is highly ecologically and biologically diverse, hosting a wide range of habitats and flora and fauna. It also includes a rich heritage of Aboriginal rock art, including highly significant sites, such as Ubirr. Kakadu is fully protected by the EPBC Act.

Kakadu is a place of enormous ecological and biological diversity. It extends from the coast and estuaries in the north through floodplains, billabongs and lowlands to rocky ridges and stone country in the south. These landscapes are home to a range of rare and endemic plants and animals, including more than one-third of Australia's bird species and one-quarter of its freshwater and estuarine fish species.️

Kakadu National Park,5.0,"Whatever you do, and no matter how many days you stay in Kakadu National Park, get ready to be amazed! It's definitely one of the most beautiful national parks I have visited in my life. It's not only the biggest territorial park in the country, but it's also listed for both cultural and natural values at the UNESCO, for more than valid reasons!
1. There are so many different kinds of landscapes you can see here, with peaceful wildlife (birds, mammals, reptiles, everything!). It's tough to stop taking photos to just peaceful enjoy the privilege of being there!
2. First nations individuals and Australian governments are actively collaborating together in a Board to protect the park in the best way possible, using traditional and modern methods.
3. The best part for history and culture enthusiasts like me is that we can visit some of the first nations' caves to see fascinating rock art paintings and old ceremony sites. We can not access so much as some sites are still being used, but that's enough to give insights and teach us a lot. For this part, it is definitely better to get a local guide to have the best explanations possible.
To be fair, I visited Nourlangie (actually Burrunggui is the right name) with a mixed Caucasian/first nations guide and with a 100% Caucasian guide, and the first one provided way more insight and stories than the second (first hand experience can never be replaced, no matter how many books someone may read). I highly recommend getting a proper local guide if you can choose.

In April, Ubirr site was sadly not accessible, but the yellow water were still high and covered by water lilies. We can't get everything I guess and that made me feel that this park deserves to be visited during different seasons (they count 6 seasons there, if I remember properly).

We visited 2 cultural centers that complete each other, but if you have time for one only then Warandjan cultural center is the best (more comprehensive and better maintained with a big shop) than the Bowali center.

In any case, don't forget to pay the fee before you enter the park and ENJOY this magical place!","Whatever you do, and no matter how many days you stay in Kakadu National Park, get ready to be amazed!",other,positive

1. There are so many different kinds of landscapes you can see here, with peaceful wildlife (birds, mammals, reptiles, everything!). It's tough to stop taking photos to just peaceful enjoy the privilege of being there!
2. First nations individuals and Australian governments are actively collaborating together in a Board to protect the park in the best way possible, using traditional and modern methods.
3. The best part for history and culture enthusiasts like me is that we can visit some of the first nations' caves to see fascinating rock art paintings and old ceremony sites.

For this part, it is definitely better to get a local guide to have the best explanations possible.

In April, Ubirr site was sadly not accessible, but the yellow water were still high and covered by water lilies. We can't get everything I guess and that made me feel that this park deserves to be visited during different seasons (they count 6 seasons there, if I remember properly).

We visited 2 cultural centers that complete each other, but if you have time for one only then Warandjan cultural center is the best (more comprehensive and better maintained with a big shop) than the Bowali center.

In any case, don't forget to pay the fee before you enter the park and ENJOY this magical place!","In any case, don't forget to pay the fee before you enter the park and ENJOY this magical place!","price, experience",positive

 Uluru – Where the Earth Speaks in Stories
Standing before Uluru (Ayers Rock), my husband and I were absolutely in awe — not just by its sheer size or its striking red glow at sunset, but by the deep, spiritual presence it holds. 
This UNESCO World Heritage site isn’t just a rock — it's a sacred site for the Anangu people, rich with ancient stories passed down through generations. Stories that teach, inspire, and guide — serving as role models for those yet to come.
 Every crevice, every color shift tells a tale.
And let’s be honest... photos don’t do it justice — you feel Uluru more than you see it.
(Pro tip: pack extra memory cards... and maybe some tissues — it’s that moving )
Grateful for this experience, and humbled by the history etched into this land.","Uluru Uluru Where the Earth Speaks in Stories Standing before Uluru (Ayers Rock), my husband and I were absolutely in awe not just by its sheer size or its striking red glow at sunset, but by the deep, spiritual presence it holds.",other,neutral

Litchfield National Park,5.0,"A great day trip. Accessible from Darwin ~1.5h. Arguably better and more accessible than Kakadu with a lot of swimming holes and day tracks. Open 24/7. Worth visiting as there are not many day trip destinations around Darwin.
A loop from Darwin- Batchelor - Litchfield - Berry springs - Darwin ia about 300km. Spend about 6-10 hours there to enjoy 3-4 spots. Can easily start from Darwin at around 6am and back to Darwin at 4pm.
2WD accessible along the main road, 4WD for some places but to explore both, you'd need at least 2 days.
⛽No fuel station inside the park, closest one is in Batchelor. Best to fill before leaving Darwin.
️ Popular spots: Wangi Fall, Florence Fall. (Best to check the reviews on specific area for more information)
‍♀️Day walk: Each spot offers ~1-3km day walk with moderate difficulty. For a day trip focusing on bush walking, it's possible to do 3-4 walks during the day. There are about 7 day walk along the main road. From my favourite to my least favourite: Wangi fall loop, Florence shady creek, Tolmer loop, Walker creek to the campsite and back, Upper Cascade, Florence to Buley, Greenants.
Overnight walk: Tabletop track, 39km multiple day hike, book online and extra preparation needed.
♿ Wheelchair friendly access includes Wangi fall and Tolmer fall (lookout point only). Some picnic area are wheelchair accessible from the car parks (such as Greenant, Walker, Buley rockhole) but mostly aren't designed for wheelchair access in mind.
‍♂️ There are so many pools. They can be very crowded. Best to come early in the morning. Pools are deep, but no current. Save for swimmers, if you are not confident, please bring inflatable noodles. Check if the swimming spots are open on the website (some are closed during wet/ early dry season due to croc risks).
Toilet + toilet paper + non potable water is normally available around car parks, but bring your own handwashing liquid.
No signal, download offline map, but you won't get lost as there is only 1 road in and out of Litchfield, there are signages around.
Bring your own food and drinking water. The only food stall is at Wangi fall, or in Batchelor town and some caravan parks between Batchelor and Litchfield.
 No rubbish bin inside the national park, carry your own rubbish bin and bring it back home.
Park is free for NT residents, interstate/ international visitors must prucase a park pass. You can only get your parks pass online. Do this before you go, no signal inside the park.
✅to bring for a day trip: swimming suit, goggles, towel, hat, sunscreen, esky, at least 2L water/person, food, hand sanitizer.
No sandflies, but mosquitos present especially at night. Flies,  spiders around river banks, not many venomous creatures to worry about, as long as you stay along the designated tracks.
⛺ Camping spots are available inside the parks, must book online, up to 6 months ahead of time but it fills up very quickly during the dry season. Various types (2wd/4wd/walking).

Litchfield National Park,5.0,"A great day trip. Accessible from Darwin ~1.5h. Arguably better and more accessible than Kakadu with a lot of swimming holes and day tracks. Open 24/7. Worth visiting as there are not many day trip destinations around Darwin.

Litchfield National Park,5.0,"A great day trip. Accessible from Darwin ~1.5h. Arguably better and more accessible than Kakadu with a lot of swimming holes and day tracks. Open 24/7. Worth visiting as there are not many day trip destinations around Darwin.
A loop from Darwin- Batchelor - Litchfield - Berry springs - Darwin ia about 300km. Spend about 6-10 hours there to enjoy 3-4 spots. Can easily start from Darwin at around 6am and back to Darwin at 4pm.
2WD accessible along the main road, 4WD for some places but to explore both, you'd need at least 2 days.
⛽No fuel station inside the park, closest one is in Batchelor. Best to fill before leaving Darwin.
️ Popular spots: Wangi Fall, Florence Fall. (Best to check the reviews on specific area for more information)
‍♀️Day walk: Each spot offers ~1-3km day walk with moderate difficulty. For a day trip focusing on bush walking, it's possible to do 3-4 walks during the day. There are about 7 day walk along the main road. From my favourite to my least favourite: Wangi fall loop, Florence shady creek, Tolmer loop, Walker creek to the campsite and back, Upper Cascade, Florence to Buley, Greenants.
Overnight walk: Tabletop track, 39km multiple day hike, book online and extra preparation needed.
♿ Wheelchair friendly access includes Wangi fall and Tolmer fall (lookout point only). Some picnic area are wheelchair accessible from the car parks (such as Greenant, Walker, Buley rockhole) but mostly aren't designed for wheelchair access in mind.
‍♂️ There are so many pools. They can be very crowded. Best to come early in the morning. Pools are deep, but no current. Save for swimmers, if you are not confident, please bring inflatable noodles. Check if the swimming spots are open on the website (some are closed during wet/ early dry season due to croc risks).
Toilet + toilet paper + non potable water is normally available around car parks, but bring your own handwashing liquid.
No signal, download offline map, but you won't get lost as there is only 1 road in and out of Litchfield, there are signages around.
Bring your own food and drinking water. The only food stall is at Wangi fall, or in Batchelor town and some caravan parks between Batchelor and Litchfield.
 No rubbish bin inside the national park, carry your own rubbish bin and bring it back home.

A loop from Darwin- Batchelor - Litchfield - Berry springs - Darwin ia about 300km. Spend about 6-10 hours there to enjoy 3-4 spots. Can easily start from Darwin at around 6am and back to Darwin at 4pm.
2WD accessible along the main road, 4WD for some places but to explore both, you'd need at least 2 days.
⛽No fuel station inside the park, closest one is in Batchelor. Best to fill before leaving Darwin.
️ Popular spots: Wangi Fall, Florence Fall. (Best to check the reviews on specific area for more information)
‍♀️Day walk: Each spot offers ~1-3km day walk with moderate difficulty. For a day trip focusing on bush walking, it's possible to do 3-4 walks during the day. There are about 7 day walk along the main road. From my favourite to my least favourite: Wangi fall loop, Florence shady creek, Tolmer loop, Walker creek to the campsite and back, Upper Cascade, Florence to Buley, Greenants.
Overnight walk: Tabletop track, 39km multiple day hike, book online and extra preparation needed.
♿ Wheelchair friendly access includes Wangi fall and Tolmer fall (lookout point only). Some picnic area are wheelchair accessible from the car parks (such as Greenant, Walker, Buley rockhole) but mostly aren't designed for wheelchair access in mind.
‍♂️ There are so many pools. They can be very crowded. Best to come early in the morning. Pools are deep, but no current. Save for swimmers, if you are not confident, please bring inflatable noodles. Check if the swimming spots are open on the website (some are closed during wet/ early dry season due to croc risks).
Toilet + toilet paper + non potable water is normally available around car parks, but bring your own handwashing liquid.
No signal, download offline map, but you won't get lost as there is only 1 road in and out of Litchfield, there are signages around.
Bring your own food and drinking water. The only food stall is at Wangi fall, or in Batchelor town and some caravan parks between Batchelor and Litchfield.
 No rubbish bin inside the national park, carry your own rubbish bin and bring it back home.
Park is free for NT residents, interstate/ international visitors must prucase a park pass. You can only get your parks pass online. Do this before you go, no signal inside the park.
✅to bring for a day trip: swimming suit, goggles, towel, hat, sunscreen, esky, at least 2L water/person, food, hand sanitizer.
No sandflies, but mosquitos present especially at night. Flies,  spiders around river banks, not many venomous creatures to worry about, as long as you stay along the designated tracks.
⛺ Camping spots are available inside the parks, must book online, up to 6 months ahead of time but it fills up very quickly during the dry season. Various types (2wd/4wd/walking).

Amazing natural scenery and beautiful falls here. I recommend getting to the falls early, if you want the place to yourself. My favorite was the Tjaynera Falls. The track in was for 4WD only and there was a river crossing so this helped keep a majority of the tourists out. I had the place to myself. Stayed two nights at the Wangi Falls campground. So great to be close to Wangi Falls, could hear them at night. Incredible view of the stars at night as there is no light pollution. I saw a couple of wallabies in the morning.

Litchfield National Park,5.0,"The drive to Litchfield National Park's first waterfall (Wangi Falls) is about 1.5 hrs from Darwin city centre.

The waterfall is about a flat 5 minute walk from the carpark. Two waterfalls and nice swim. Has toilet facilities but no toilet paper ... also a cafeteria onsite.

The next one we visited was Tolma Falls. You can only view it from a platform and its about 15 min walk down hill but bring water as uphill walk back to car gets very hot.

The falls we enjoyed the most is Florence waterfalls.
The plunge pool is awesome

There is 2 different ways to access it. Suggest go down to the falls via stairs as its a steeper decline and walk back via the track on.way back to car. Takes about 30 each way.

2 waterfalls.
Gorgeous swim and so clear. Near the rocky shallow part u do get fish that nibble at your feet.

Suggest to bring
1. a swimming noodle to swim out to where the falls enter the lagoon.
2. Small umbrellas on days expecting rain especially if you are with a baby or wanting to protect your belongings like electronic devices

Recommend driving over a tour as you can spend as much time as you like.

But Wangi falls and Florence falls were incredible. Wangi is so accessible for anyone - easy walk from the car park plus plenty of viewing space on the grass.

There are water stops on the way round with nice cold water and on the boat,  if you are caught short,  there is a toilet.  You can do canoe adventure tours, helecopter tours and cultural tours.

Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,5.0,"Cooinda Lodge is part of the Accor Group, so was able to access my member discount/upgrade. With that in mind, we booked one of their Yellow Water Villas for four nights and were so glad we did. The villas take glamping to a new level. Elevated on stilts, you are completely immersed in the surrounding bush, overlooking the Yellow Water billabong. Our villa, ""Barramundi"", was so luxurious, spacious, filled with light and extra features. It was like a five-star hotel room with an outlook that can't be beaten. It even had an outdoor bathtub on the deck.

The staff at the lodge were extremely helpful. The breakfast, which was included, at Mimi's Restaurant was really good - plenty of choices, freshly brewed coffee and squeezed juices. We spent so much time trekking around Kakadu then we didn't get much time to appreciate all the features at the lodge, however we did get the opportunity to watch the footy on the big screen whilst have dinner at the Barra Bar.

Perfect location to take advantage of the sunrise and sunset Yellow Water Cruises, as the bus picked us up from a stop in front of the main reception.

Would thoroughly recommend Cooinda Lodge for being a bit of luxury set amongst an amazing bushland setting.","Cooinda Lodge is part of the Accor Group, so was able to access my member discount/upgrade.",other,neutral

Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,5.0,"Cooinda lodge @ Kakadu is the best!!! - it’s the first stop of our 2-week Australia trip. Our 3-night stay from check-in at reception to booking cruise tour to check out were seamless and exceptional. Staff were really helpful, rooms are clean, and the food quality blew our socks off.

we booked the breakfast package and it exceeded our expectations - the fresh orange juice and DIY fresh veggies (beets, ginger, carrots, cucumber) juice station were amazing. we ate dinner at the lodge every night - we loved the kangaroo steak, pizza, fish curry and linguini. So delicious. The drinks are great also.

Location is perfect for day trips drive to see nearby sites; it’s also easy to spend the day at the lodge; the cultural center is a short walk away.

Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,5.0,"Amazing place! Make an excuse to go here! I went during the end of wet season (big difference in the place in different seasons). Food was splendid with loads to choose and they changed the ingredients in one thing I tried which was brilliant! Accessibility was ok with a regular step to get into the regular Lodge room. Back door was a wide veranda sliding door which was pretty flat. Spotless rooms! Aircon worked great! Plenty of plug sockets in good place. No wifi in the Lodge rooms. Rainfall shower head only. Bit of a walk to the parking areas across grass, and they seemed to fill fast without assigned parking, but if you need help getting about they have a small golf cart, although that has a huge step to get up. Pool had a nice ramp leading down into it, no railing though and with a small step on the edge of the pool. Staff were amazing! Very happy to help in any way possible! I was made to feel very welcome. On site attractions are well worth doing. Small shop at reception has loads of essential items and fuel. 60km drive to closest town of Jabiru. I want to stay here again some day for a different season. Only happy memories of this place.",Amazing place!,experience,positive

Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,5.0,"We stayed in a medium sized powered site for a few nights. The pool is absolutely amazing with heaps of space and different depths, which is great for kids. The jumping pillow, playground were also a hit with the kids. The camp kitchen is minimal but enough. If you want the full resort experience that is available to you. Great grounds and atmosphere. If you've been to El Questro think of that but way less commercialised (even though this is still a commercially run operation for sure ).

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,5.0,We had one night in Jabiru which was our last night in Kakadu.  I found the hotel really lovely - the front desk team were very warm and welcoming.  The restaurant meals (Dinner & Breakfast) were fantastic - way beyond my expectations.  I shared a room with a friend and we had 2 double beds -  I was surprised how much room we had. The room had sliding doors opening out onto the grass which gave a nice open feel to the room.  (And thank you for the hairdryer in the room - it's the little things :-) ) I also loved the Indigenous art everywhere.  I would definitely stay at The Croc again.,We had one night in Jabiru which was our last night in Kakadu.,other,neutral

I highly recommend setting aside time to explore—it feels like a treasure hunt with the added reward of supporting the local community.

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,5.0,"Why don't I have any photos of this wonderful hotel? We were having just too good a time.

This hotel is in the heart of the Kakadu National Park. Make sure you have the permits you need to travel and refuel in and out of this area as access is restricted.

That said, once here, this hotel has the most lovely, attentive staff in reception and everywhere. Nothing was too much trouble, if they didn't have something to hand, they knew who did and got right on the phone.

The menu in the restaurant is not extensive, but the choice is wide enough that there is something for everyone, and what they do have is cooked to perfection. I had Kangaroo loin like I have never ad it before, slightly smoked and a joy to the palate.

Lots of nice cold beer and wine, and a buffer breakfast with all the vest and fresh you could want.

There's a lovely pool, plentiful indigenous arts and craft on display and for sale, and a pleasant gift shop with some items at prices significantly lower than in the ""big smoke."". I paid $55 for an indigenous shirt that was being sold in Darwin for 90.

Plenty of opportunities for walks, lookouts, river cruises and local attractions within an easy 30 minute drive

A well run business worthy of your visit and your return.",Why don't I have any photos of this wonderful hotel?,environment,positive

Mindil Beach Casino Resort,5.0,"Without a doubt, the best location to stay in Darwin!
My experience at Mindil Beach Casino Resort was absolutely outstanding from start to finish. I received a warm and welcoming reception upon arrival, and was even able to check in a little early – a much appreciated gesture after a long day of travel.

My room was beautiful: spacious, tastefully decorated, and with a breathtaking view of the ocean. Everything was spotlessly clean and the entire hotel smells wonderfully fresh. You can truly feel the care and attention that goes into every detail here.

The facilities are fantastic – two stunning swimming pools (one with a view of the sea), direct beach access within walking distance, and a range of high-quality restaurants that serve delicious food. Dining here is a real treat!

Perfect location, right next to the Mindil Market as well.

What truly makes this resort stand out is the exceptional service. The staff are warm, professional, and quick to assist with anything you might need. A special shout-out to Sreena Amir and Kellie who went above and beyond to make my stay feel extra special – thank you for your kindness and hospitality!

If I had to mention one small point for improvement: there are no power outlets directly next to the bed, which made charging my phone slightly inconvenient. But honestly, that’s the only minor detail in what was otherwise a flawless experience.

I would absolutely recommend Mindil Beach Casino Resort to anyone looking for luxury, relaxation, and top-tier service in Darwin.","Without a doubt, the best location to stay in Darwin!",other,negative

If I had to mention one small point for improvement: there are no power outlets directly next to the bed, which made charging my phone slightly inconvenient. But honestly, that’s the only minor detail in what was otherwise a flawless experience.

My experience at Mindil Beach Casino Resort was absolutely outstanding from start to finish. I received a warm and welcoming reception upon arrival, and was even able to check in a little early – a much appreciated gesture after a long day of travel.

My room was beautiful: spacious, tastefully decorated, and with a breathtaking view of the ocean. Everything was spotlessly clean and the entire hotel smells wonderfully fresh. You can truly feel the care and attention that goes into every detail here.

The facilities are fantastic – two stunning swimming pools (one with a view of the sea), direct beach access within walking distance, and a range of high-quality restaurants that serve delicious food. Dining here is a real treat!

Facilities were thoughtfully laid out, with toilets at both ends, portable ATMs, and plenty of parking (we Ubered there with no trouble at all).

Prices were a little above average, but that’s expected in Darwin.

Mindil Beach Sunset Market,5.0,"The Mindil Beach Markets are a must-visit — and it’s easy to see why they’re one of Darwin’s top attractions. The atmosphere was incredible, set right by the beach with a stunning sunset over the water that truly added to the magic.

Mindil Beach Sunset Market,5.0,"I always visit the Mindil Beach Sunset Markets while I am in Darwin,  as it is always a highlight for me:) The markets run every Thursday and Sunday from 4 pm to 9 pm, during the dry season which is late April through to late October.

It does get extremely busy, so the crowds might not be for everyone. But the main attraction is the sunset. The view from Mindil Beach is pretty special; The sun looks bigger here as it sets right over the Arafura sea and you get that uninterrupted horizon. It’s one of those sunsets that really stops you in your tracks. Everyone claps when it is over because it is spectacular!

There’s a great mix of street food stalls, local arts and crafts, and live music. I even saw people doing camel rides along the beach as the sun was coming down.

Something to note – you can’t bring dogs into the market area, unless it’s a certified assistance dog. It’s a bit of a shame if you’re travelling with your pet, but good to know before you go.

In July, the sun sets around 6.30 pm, so it’s worth getting there early to find a good spot, and get a good car park. If you’re visiting Darwin, this is a must-do – especially for that sunset.","I always visit the Mindil Beach Sunset Markets while I am in Darwin, as it is always a highlight for me:) The markets run every Thursday and Sunday from 4pm to 9pm, during the dry season which is late April through to late October.",other,positive

Mindil Beach Sunset Market,5.0,"We visited in mid July, where the temperatures are @ 30 degrees celcius during the day. Mindil Beach Market is held 4pm-9pm on Thur's & Sun's. From Darwin CBD, it's 5min drive or 10min by bus No.4 from outside Woolworths Cavendagh. Wear hat & bring a water bottle, as there's not a lot of shade. Wear comfy shoes as short walk to from bus to market (6min / 200m on fairly flat ground), but careful of white shoes, as carpark is red dirt. Heat drops down after sunset. Bring handwipes/serviettes/hand sanitiser if you like to stay clean & fresh as theres lots of people & lots of yummy food trucks. Lines for food can be a bit long, but so worth it. Be aware- most of the food vendors DON'T sell drinks, however there are many vendors selling different types of fresh drinks, like tropical juices etc. We had the famous Croc burger, the patty has fresh mango & sweet chilli- amazing, & the chips that were an optional side were delicious & a generous portion. We also tried the BBQ prawns on skewers- yum!! Constant fresh supply being brought out to serve. The market stalls- so much jewelry,  lots of freshwater pearls. Lots of clothing, art & crafts, Crocodile/tourism souvenirs, although some items overpriced. Sunset at beach was lovely, however packed with people. We visited from 5pm-7pm & that was long enough to get around all the stalls, grab dinner & eat, & a quick peek at the beach. Definitely worth an evening out","We visited in mid July, where the temperatures are @ 30 degrees celcius during the day.",other,neutral

Wear comfy shoes as short walk to from bus to market (6min / 200m on fairly flat ground), but careful of white shoes, as carpark is red dirt. Heat drops down after sunset. Bring handwipes/serviettes/hand sanitiser if you like to stay clean & fresh as theres lots of people & lots of yummy food trucks. Lines for food can be a bit long, but so worth it. Be aware- most of the food vendors DON'T sell drinks, however there are many vendors selling different types of fresh drinks, like tropical juices etc. We had the famous Croc burger, the patty has fresh mango & sweet chilli- amazing, & the chips that were an optional side were delicious & a generous portion. We also tried the BBQ prawns on skewers- yum!! Constant fresh supply being brought out to serve. The market stalls- so much jewelry,  lots of freshwater pearls. Lots of clothing, art & crafts, Crocodile/tourism souvenirs, although some items overpriced. Sunset at beach was lovely, however packed with people. We visited from 5pm-7pm & that was long enough to get around all the stalls, grab dinner & eat, & a quick peek at the beach. Definitely worth an evening out","Sunset at beach was lovely, however packed with people.",other,positive

Mindil Beach Sunset Market,5.0,"During the dry season, this market opens twice a week. There are many food options here, and my favorite is a small seafood stall with a blue tent, selling cooked lobster, mud crab, octopus, large prawns, and oysters. I’ve been here several times and tried them all—they're all fresh and delicious. Afterward, I head to a fresh juice stall for a cup of mixed juice or fruit tea. Finally, I go to a fruit stall to buy some freshly peeled jackfruit as dessert. For me, that’s a perfect dinner. As the sky gradually darkens and turns pink, I watch the beautiful sunset on the beach. There’s a special tradition here: when the sun finally dips below the horizon, everyone cheers and claps, celebrating the end of the hot day and the arrival of the cool, comfortable evening. This night market also has many stalls selling local handicrafts, Aboriginal artwork, musical instruments, and small accessories, which are nice to browse through. There’s a live performance area, where you can sit down to enjoy the show while eating. Both adults and children can have a wonderful evening here.","During the dry season, this market opens twice a week.",other,neutral

I’ve been here several times and tried them all—they're all fresh and delicious. Afterward, I head to a fresh juice stall for a cup of mixed juice or fruit tea. Finally, I go to a fruit stall to buy some freshly peeled jackfruit as dessert. For me, that’s a perfect dinner. As the sky gradually darkens and turns pink, I watch the beautiful sunset on the beach. There’s a special tradition here: when the sun finally dips below the horizon, everyone cheers and claps, celebrating the end of the hot day and the arrival of the cool, comfortable evening. This night market also has many stalls selling local handicrafts, Aboriginal artwork, musical instruments, and small accessories, which are nice to browse through. There’s a live performance area, where you can sit down to enjoy the show while eating. Both adults and children can have a wonderful evening here.","Theres a live performance area, where you can sit down to enjoy the show while eating.",experience,positive

I spent a few hours here (and didn't do the croc cage). You can experience holding a baby croc and they have several presentations throughout the day including fish feeding, and talks on the reptiles, turtles and crocs.

I really recommend doing the diving with crocs option as it's so much fun and you really get a lot of time in the water with these amazing animals. We were probably in the water 30 min, with them swimming right up against the tube and feeding right there by our faces.

Feeding the baby alligators was also super fun, they are so active and they jump so high that it's a lot of fun and good for the kids. You have to be at least 15 for swimming in the tube with the big guys but the children can do it with the babies instead.

Super great people, all very pleasant, kind, and knowledgeable. The reptile exhibits and aquarium are also good. We had a wonderful afternoon and would definitely recommend this for anyone!",I wasn't sure what to expect but this was really beyond what I'd hoped for.,other,positive

Crocosaurus Cove,5.0,"If you’re exploring Darwin, this would be a good place to check out, esp if you have kids!  From memory, there are fish, turtles, snakes, lizards and of cos saltwater crocs.

You can also hold a small croc and take a photo which is additional cost.

Highly recommended from Kimberley Information & Travel Centre in Broome.","At first, I couldnt book a ticket online and thought it might be closed, but it turns out there was just a problem with their booking system.",price,negative

So much knowledge for someone so young. We held crocs, snakes and lizards, and were able to take our own photos. We fed some smaller crocs and then got to feed a big 5m croc Burt, which was amazing.

Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,,"Cooinda really exceeded my expectations! I thought it was going to be another basic, over-priced Aussie stay, but everything was wonderful, from the comfort in the glamping tent (the beds were like clouds!), to the quality of the amenities (super clean bathrooms and fresh towels provided), to how good the food was. I had a delicious kangaroo burger for dinner because ‘when in the outback’ and it was so tasty! Honestly I loved our stay! The pool was beautiful and got so much sun, the breakfast was varied and super fresh and the yellow water cruise was great! Batch was our guide and he was SO knowledgeable, we learned so much from him, without it being overbearing. I’d absolutely visit again!

Cooinda Lodge Kakadu,,"Cooinda Lodge is part of the Accor Group, so was able to access my member discount/upgrade.

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,,"We had a good stay here. As some of the reviews mention, the rooms / bathrooms are a bit tired but they are perfectly fine and clean. The shower is in the bath tub (not sure if that is the case for all rooms). We booked a courtyard room to make sure we were on the ground floor.||The WiFi works well but we couldn’t get casting to work on the tv. The tv had the usual free to air channels. The air conditioning was good. The little bar fridge was excellent.||The restaurant was great. The breakfast buffet had good choices. We really enjoyed the dinner buffet - the beer battered barramundi and yellow chicken curry were stand outs.

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,,This is a pretty tired hotel in need of an upgrade. Rooms are basic and seem to have been temporarily and continually patched up. Food was either a canteen level buffet or not that great a la carte. The hotel seems to cater for large numbers of tourists on coach tours rather than individuals. That being said there is nowhere else to stay other than a caravan park and you don't go to Kakadu for the accommodation and fine dining. The tours (they were not run by the hotel) were fine and interesting.

Food was either a canteen level buffet or not that great a la carte. The hotel seems to cater for large numbers of tourists on coach tours rather than individuals. That being said there is nowhere else to stay other than a caravan park and you don't go to Kakadu for the accommodation and fine dining.

Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel,,Great place. Not sure where else you can stay in a crocodile shaped hotel.

Restaurant is great but avoid the Kangaroo steak as the flies go crazy for it and swarm even inside as they’re trained for thousands of years to go for the kangaroo meat smell. Clothes washing really cheap only $4.50 a wash load in hotel laundromat. Pool really nice. Prices on indigenous art competitive. This hotel is an oasis in a very remote place that we called home for four nights.,Great place.,other,positive

Mindil Beach Casino Resort,,"I was disappointed in this accomodation , we stayed in the older section of the resort , near the infinity pool , which had loud music playing for 5 hours in the afternoon - not very  relaxing . I was also disappointed in the room service - our room was not serviced at all one day and I was advised that servicing of the rooms occurs between 3pm-5pm - not great when you have been out all day and are ready to then relax and shower before going out again.
