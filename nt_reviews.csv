regional,Google Places,Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park,"📌 Uluru
🌄 Uluru – Where the Earth Speaks in Stories
Standing before Uluru (Ayers Rock), my husband and I were absolutely in awe — not just by its sheer size or its striking red glow at sunset, but by the deep, spiritual presence it holds. 💫
This UNESCO World Heritage site isn’t just a rock — it's a sacred site for the Anangu people, rich with ancient stories passed down through generations. Stories that teach, inspire, and guide — serving as role models for those yet to come.
💬 Every crevice, every color shift tells a tale.
And let’s be honest... photos don’t do it justice — you feel Uluru more than you see it.
(Pro tip: pack extra memory cards... and maybe some tissues — it’s that moving 😅)
Grateful for this experience, and humbled by the history etched into this land.",5,2 weeks ago,,,,
regional,Google Places,Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park,"One of the best experiences I’ve ever had. This place is full of mystical vibes and Indigenous culture. Here you can really imagine how the Natives used to live in ancient times and how important this place has been for their culture. If you’re looking for a truly authentic experience in the Red Centre, this is exactly what you’re searching for",5,2 months ago,,,,
regional,Google Places,Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park,"One of the most iconic places in Australia and just as I expected it did not disappointed me.
This famous rock is bigger than I expected, 2,5km long and 350m height.
From every corner of this rock you can admire its particular shapes levigated by rain and wind and its different colors in a shadow and sun light play.
We reached it from Alice Spring after 5 hours by bus but it’s worth it every minute we spent on long straight desert roads.",5,4 weeks ago,,,,
regional,Google Places,Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park,"A pleasant, easy walk around the base offering stunning views. It’s a shame we could no longer hike or climb to the top - reckon the views would be even more breathtaking. The guided walk was informative & the ranger was friendly and knowledgeable. The area was well-equipped with basic facilities like toilets and drinking water. The walk to the cultural center took about 35 minutes.",5,8 months ago,,,,
regional,Google Places,Kata Tjuta / Mount Olga,"This afternoon I did the Valley of the Winds hike at Kata Tjuṯa, about a half-hour drive from Yulara. There are two main lookouts, and at the second one, you can look right through the valley while a cool breeze sweeps past – a welcome relief in the warm sun.

It’s mind-blowing to think this rock was formed over 550 million years ago, before there was life on land, back when Australia was part of a much larger supercontinent.

Photos aren’t allowed once you’re on the hike, but from a nearby lookout we caught some amazing late-afternoon views of both Kata Tjuṯa and Uluru. Nature at its absolute best.",5,a month ago,,,,

I am in love with Uluru and I truly acknowledge its sacred and spiritual energy but this is something that goes way beyond. Kata Tjuta has carved its name into my Soul from the very first time I visited it. I keep going back and it keeps filling my heart with the most spectacular energy and healing power. This place is a gate through another dimension, you can truly sense the Creation time through its harmonious curves and astonishing red dust. I could truly get lost there and no need anything else but its beauty. If you want a life changing experience this is the place. Thank you so much for keeping this place accessible and open to public. Its healing power goes beyond words.",5,4 months ago,,,,

regional,Google Places,Kings Canyon,"Amazing! Paid $10 per adult and I think $5 for a child for a day pass. Don't like the online system to book that but is what it is. But oh my King's Canyon itself is amazingly stunning! We did the Rim Walk which was a 6km loop. Those 500 steps at the beginning of the walk were the worst part for me!! The views from the top were amazing!! Took us three hours to complete - with lots of stops and rest breaks! Eden's garden was beautiful!!
At the beginning there were lots of information boards, toilets and water bubblers - place to refill water bottles too! Tracks are very well maintained.

regional,Google Places,Kings Canyon,Amazing experience from start to finish. The scenery is breath taking and the views are great. Well worth the steep climb at the start for the rim walk and yes I do recommend the lookout walk and the garden of Eden. Will add 2 kms to the walk but so worth it. You will have to buy a day pass for NT National parks 10 dollars each for adults and 5 for children. Definitely worth it. After you can cruise up the creek walk to the big platform and see the rocks and trees from below it's also beautiful.,5,4 months ago,,,,
regional,Google Places,Kings Canyon,The rim walk is definitely 3-4 hrs and challenging but it is worth it with awesome landscapes and little gems like the garden of Eden.

regional,Google Places,Nawurlandja Lookout,"Moving experience here. The view is stunning from the top and as the sign says, it will take your breath away.

You can just go to the ""gallery"" area or the whole way up to the lookout over Arnhem Land which I recommend. Visually stunning and moving. Climbing over uneven rocks is necessary but there are some bannisters installed. Limited mobility may not make it to the very top as there is free climbing involved.

regional,Google Places,Jim Jim Falls,"Amazing natural scenes. We went as part of a tour, arriving early. When we left (early afternoon) the car park was full.

Challenging walk in and out, but well worth it.

You can swim to the falls after clambering through across the initial lagoons and rocks. The swim is approx 200m each way across deep water. As you approach the falls, you swim into a strong breeze and small water chop. It’s not for the unfit.",5,2 months ago,,,,

The 50km dirtroad is corrugated but not too bad as Gunlom right now.
The last 10km is a 4WD track where you go through creeks, that last part took us 45min. because we are heavy loaded.
Really worth it!",5,a month ago,,,,
regional,Google Places,Jim Jim Falls,"Went to the falls in the last week of September. Absolutely stunning-the high cliffs and deep plunge pool are worth the drive in for sure. The road was fantastic as graders had just gone through. Two ankle high areas of water in the last 5 km of the trail, we managed to make it through in a BMW X5. Quite a bit of a walk in over large rocks (see photos)-we took 40 minutes and are fairly confident walkers.",5,11 months ago,,,,
regional,Google Places,Jim Jim Falls,"Thanks Audrey Senior for your review - it certainly helped us today.
The road today had a lot of very deep corrugations and rocky ridges through the road.  The good news is the graders are there so the road was already in better shape on our way out.  It’s a slow trip as it is a 60km speed limit.  Please stick to the limit.  There were a few people overtaking us in the way out doing up near 100km and the dust created was thick and just hangs.  Just because you can drive faster does not mean you should.  There is a valid reason for the slower speed limits.
We arrived at 10am and there were already a few tour buses there and about 10 cars.  We only saw a few people on the walk in.  Make sure you wear decent hiking boots for the walk in and out.  Even through there were a few people around we did not feel like it was over crowded.  If you are not a confident swimmer then take your pool noodles  no as the water gets deep quickly.
When you go for a swim be warned of the crows.  They will go through your bag and pinch what they can.  There are 2 of them and one will distract you whilst the other pinches items from your bag so make sure your portions as stored in your bag and your bag is zippered shut.  They are cheeky buggers.
We left the carpark just after 2pm and there were still people arriving.  We were lucky enough to only have 1 car come through the narrow 4wd section of the road from the campground area and were in a position where we could pull over to let them pass.
The 4wd action of the track is not too bad.  There is water crossings are shallow and there is only a couple of sandy section.  The road does twist, turn and undulate so you do need to have the height clearance.  The road is quite narrow but there are only a couple of spots where it is difficult to see oncoming traffic.
The falls are not flowing at the moment but there is still a lot of water in the area so it’s still worth the trip.
Loved it.  Would love to stay at the Kim Jim
campgrounds and spend more time in the area doing the 6k hike, lookout and twin falls but that will have to be another trip.",5,a year ago,,,,
regional,Google Places,Litchfield National Park,"Very nice vibe for a relaxing weekend.

A few spiders as well.

A very enjoyable moment.",5,a week ago,,,,
regional,Google Places,Litchfield National Park,"I spent one day exploring Litchfield National Park, and it was definitely not enough time to fully appreciate it. However, I was able to visit nearly all the main sites accessible by SUV. Every stop, except for Bamboo Creek, had well-maintained facilities such as restrooms and picnic tables. I also found the information boards at each location very useful – they provide detailed insights about the park, which is especially important since mobile reception is limited.

regional,Google Places,Litchfield National Park,"Most of the experience was great as always but I think the campsites at the 2wd Florence Falls camp-site are too close together and noise carries very easily even when you are trying to be quiet. I guess it does depend on the people in the camp grounds but it isn't realistic to expect people to whisper all the time once the sun goes down. Other than that, the swimming spots are clean, well maintained and always beautiful. Always a good trip out to Litchfield!",4,2 months ago,,,,
regional,Google Places,Florence Falls Waterhole,"A stunning spot for a swim and easily one of my favourite attractions in Litchfield National Park.

There are two access options: a steep staircase of around 130 steps or a longer, stair-free path that’s more accessible. We visited around midday on a Tuesday — it was fairly busy, but still plenty of space to enjoy the water.

The twin waterfalls aren’t immediately visible from the viewing area, but once you’re in the pool, they reveal themselves beautifully. The swim to the falls is short and manageable — unlike Wangi or Edith Falls, which require a longer swim. I’d highly recommend bringing a pool noodle (a Territory essential!) as the water is deep and it makes floating much more relaxing.

Sitting beneath the falls with water cascading over you was incredibly refreshing. For the adventurous, there are rock ledges nearby to climb and jump from. There’s also a calm, shallow creek off to the side for a more laid-back experience.

Perfect for all swimming levels — an absolute must-visit.",5,a month ago,,,,
regional,Google Places,Florence Falls Waterhole,Amazing waterfalls where you can swim during the dry season (once marked safe to do so). Lots of little rock pools to just dip your feet in if you aren't keen for a swim. Absolutely beautiful location although it can get busy in peak periods. You can swim right behind one of the waterfalls in one area which is an amazing experience. Just note you do need to swim against the flow of water to get to the actual waterfall itself which can be more tiring than expected.,5,a month ago,,,,
regional,Google Places,Florence Falls Waterhole,"hidden gem in Litchfield National Park. The twin waterfalls cascading into a clear, refreshing plunge pool are perfect for a swim, especially on a hot day.

The sheer scale of the gorges, the rugged cliffs, and the peaceful Katherine River winding through it all make this place unforgettable.

It’s not just the scenery, but the sense of history and culture here that makes it so special. The connection to the Jawoyn people is deeply felt, and it adds such richness to the experience.

It does get extremely busy, so the crowds might not be for everyone. But the main attraction is the sunset. The view from Mindil Beach is pretty special; The sun looks bigger here as it sets right over the Arafura sea and you get that uninterrupted horizon. It’s one of those sunsets that really stops you in your tracks. Everyone claps when it is over because it is spectacular!

There’s a great mix of street food stalls, local arts and crafts, and live music. I even saw people doing camel rides along the beach as the sun was coming down.

Something to note – you can’t bring dogs into the market area, unless it’s a certified assistance dog. It’s a bit of a shame if you’re travelling with your pet, but good to know before you go.

There’s a huge variety of food stalls offering global cuisines — from American and Southern European to Southeast Asian and classic Aussie — alongside quirky arts and crafts, all run by local vendors. Supporting NT small businesses made the experience even more meaningful.

Live music and whip-cracking demonstrations added to the entertainment, and for something a little different, camel rides along the beach are also available. Facilities were thoughtfully laid out, with toilets at both ends, portable ATMs, and plenty of parking (we Ubered there with no trouble at all).

city,Google Places,George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens,"A mouthful of a name for Darwin's Botanic gardens but George Brown is the very reason it is still in a good state after Cyclone Tracey of 1974. Did a guided walk with Walk Darwin & according to guide John, this was not the only cyclone to wreak damage in the gardens.

It is expansive, so you will get an excellent workout as it is set on a hilly slope - find a layout map if you want to get through it all.

Notable section is the Madagascar & African garden with massive Baob trees incl the local native Adansonia Gregorii.

Waterfall has not worked for quite awhile & it is evident parts of the garden is neglected. Interesting tropical trees like Ashoka Seraca (religious significance to Buddhists), toxic Suicide Tree (Cerberus Odallam) - up there with Death Cap mushies 🫣, Pride of Burma Amhertsia, Black Bean Moreton chestnut tree, Sausage Tree (er.. rr..true - from Africa) & quite few others used in perfumes, medicinal oils or just plain quirky.

Main entrance is actually across the road from Mindil Sunset Beach area - look for Eva's Cafe on google which is just past  entrance. Interesting sculptures scattered around, some good & others like the dinosaurs in the cycad area plain garish (cast off from elsewhere). The Centre is worth a visit for background & seed saving history. We spotted a Rufuos Owl & you will see & hear the ubiquitous native scrubfowls.

Great place to come and sit, read a book, go for a walk or have a picnic.",5,3 months ago,,,,
city,Google Places,George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens,"Nice gardens but the kids play area is a miss. Supposed to be renovated but just fenced off doesn't look like anything is happening and was supposed to be finished by now. My grandson was very disappointed.

city,Google Places,George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens,"We came to have a look the garden today (5 June 2025 ), went to their information centre, got the map of the garden. Very difficult to follow the map and the actual garden especially when you're an elderly. A few section were closed today.
The garden itself was well kept, tidy and clean.  Ended up spending the whole morning at the nice Cafe there.",3,3 months ago,,,,

city,Google Places,George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens,"A mouthful of a name for Darwin's Botanic gardens but George Brown is the very reason it is still in a good state after Cyclone Tracey of 1974. Did a guided walk with Walk Darwin & according to guide John, this was not the only cyclone to wreak damage in the gardens.

It is expansive, so you will get an excellent workout as it is set on a hilly slope - find a layout map if you want to get through it all.

Notable section is the Madagascar & African garden with massive Baob trees incl the local native Adansonia Gregorii.

Waterfall has not worked for quite awhile & it is evident parts of the garden is neglected. Interesting tropical trees like Ashoka Seraca (religious significance to Buddhists), toxic Suicide Tree (Cerberus Odallam) - up there with Death Cap mushies 🫣, Pride of Burma Amhertsia, Black Bean Moreton chestnut tree, Sausage Tree (er.. rr..true - from Africa) & quite few others used in perfumes, medicinal oils or just plain quirky.

Main entrance is actually across the road from Mindil Sunset Beach area - look for Eva's Cafe on google which is just past  entrance. Interesting sculptures scattered around, some good & others like the dinosaurs in the cycad area plain garish (cast off from elsewhere). The Centre is worth a visit for background & seed saving history. We spotted a Rufuos Owl & you will see & hear the ubiquitous native scrubfowls.

Wld be really good to visit this special garden in the wet season - bit too hot, humid & parched on our guided tour on Sun 27/7/25 a week ago to enjoy it properly though I still did!",4,a month ago,,,,

city,Google Places,Fannie Bay Gaol,Free museum to see an outdoor prison from back in the day. Takes about 30mins-1 hour to see it all. Great for tourists visiting darwin.,5,a month ago,,,,
city,Google Places,Fannie Bay Gaol,"This is an unexpectedly delightful attraction, and it's completely free. Although the site isn't large, the visit experience is excellent. At the entrance, a staff member hands out a map and kindly informs us that we can listen to an audio guide by scanning a QR code with our phones. The process is very easy, and we followed the suggested route on the map. Each room had interesting explanations, and the entire visit took about an hour. It’s definitely a place worth seeing.",5,a year ago,,,,

city,Google Places,Fannie Bay Gaol,"We used the Walking Tour App and it was excellent. This Tour is a MUST DO in Darwin...very sobering.

The gorgeous location at Fannie Bay a surreal contrast. Memorable!",5,a month ago,,,,
city,Google Places,Fannie Bay Gaol,"It was worth a visit. I didn't have great expectations but was pleasantly surprised. Self guided tour is very informative with different stories of inmates along the way. Very primative considering is only closed in 1979. Free entry, donations welcomed but no pushed.

city,Google Places,Darwin Military Museum,"The Darwin Military Museum is a must-visit if you’re in Darwin! 🇦🇺✨ I found it fascinating because it really brings the city’s history to life, especially the events of 1942 during World War II.

Walking through the museum, you get to see an impressive collection of army trucks 🚛, uniforms 🎖️, and historic weapons 🔫. The displays are well set out and give you a real sense of what Darwin went through during the bombing raids. The multimedia presentations and exhibits make the history feel alive — it’s not just reading information, it’s like stepping back in time.

If you love history, the military, or just want to understand Darwin on a deeper level, this place is definitely worth the visit. 🙌",5,a week ago,,,,
city,Google Places,Darwin Military Museum,"WOW. This has to one of the best museums I have visited in a long time. The cinema was so great and the movie was very well made. Displays were also well worth the visit, and as someone coming from Europe, it was nice to see all the exhibits and get a view on the war from the other side of the world. We spent good well over two hours and we would definetely come again.
Thank you",5,a week ago,,,,
city,Google Places,Darwin Military Museum,"Wow! You need to stop here and allow a few hours! There is an interactive room that locks up and plays a re-enactment of the day Darwin was bombed; there is an interactive table which allows you to listen to first count stories and there are so many areas & stories to read and explore! So much thought has gone into this museum and it is well looked after. Plenty of parking, toilets and a tiny Cafe and gift shop. Well done to Norm & the staff. Will be taking all out Southern Visitors to share this exceptional experience.",5,3 months ago,,,,
city,Google Places,Darwin Military Museum,"Quite good if your ok with self guided. There was a lot to look at and the information was good but you need a fair amount of time to read everything.

The interactive screens are good and the show was informative but left out a lot of details, leaving you searching for more info.
I thought I would have a better understanding of the history leaving the theatre, but then found it in pieces while walking around the property.",4,5 months ago,,,,

city,Google Places,Darwin Wave Lagoon,Great fun. Never too old to be a child. Grab a tube and bounce up and down with the waves. They’re pretty strong actually. Multiple lifeguards. They have lockers but bathrooms to change outside. Drink and snack stand. Waves start every 15 after and 15 till to give those a break to get in and out and just float or swim without the ups and downs.,5,a month ago,,,,
city,Google Places,Darwin Wave Lagoon,"Really fun for the kids and adults alike! Staff are friendly, there are lockers inside the fenced area for a fee (self-serving and only big enough for small bags), lounge chairs and some bench seats. No toilets or change rooms inside, you have to leave and go to the toilets near the beach lagoon. Your entry fee is for the whole day, just keep your wrist band on. Waves are every 15 minutes and last 15 minutes. Super fun and you can bring your own ring tube. There's a kiosk for drinks and food. A nice day out.",4,2 months ago,,,,

There were still waves, but they weren't as big as possible.

Get to see the ladies ""dive for a diamond"" on Friday 14 February, A Hot 100 competition.

They also hold water aerobics on Dunday mornings from the wave pool.
